### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

#### Phase 1: PDF Download ✅
- Successfully downloaded 5 OpenStax mathematics textbooks
- Total size: 270.8 MB of educational content

#### Phase 2: Text Extraction ✅
- Used `pdfplumber` library for accurate text extraction
- Extracted 6.3+ million characters of mathematical content
- Preserved text structure and formatting

#### Phase 3: Vector Embeddings ✅
- Chunked text into ~1000 character segments with overlap
- Generated embeddings using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model
- Successfully uploaded 7,249 vectors to Pinecone
- Each vector includes metadata for source attribution

### 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 3: RAG Backend)

Your knowledge base is now ready! The next phase involves:

1. **Firebase Cloud Functions Setup**
   - Create `getMathExplanation` callable function
   - Implement RAG query pipeline
   - Add error handling and rate limiting

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Build UI components for math assistance
   - Connect to backend RAG service
   - Implement result display with citations

3. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Test query accuracy and relevance
   - Optimize chunk retrieval
   - Fine-tune prompt engineering

Solution
ⓐ
Is 5,625 divisible by 2?
No.
Does it end in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8?
5,625 is not divisible by 2.
ⓑ
Is 5,625 divisible by 3?
What is the sum of the digits? 5+6+2+5=18
Yes.
Is the sum divisible by 3?
5,625 is divisible by 3.
ⓒ
Is 5,625 divisible by 5 or 10?
What is the last digit? It is 5. 5,625 is divisible by 5 but not by 10.
ⓓ
Is 5,625 divisible by 6?
Is it divisible by both 2 and 3? No, 5,625 is not divisible by 2, so 5,625 is not divisible by 6.

of 9, we say 72 is divisible by 9. We can express this still another way.
Since 8·9=72, we say that 8 and 9 arefactorsof 72. When we write 72=8·9, we say we have factored 72.
Other ways to factor 72 are 1·72, 2·36, 3·24, 4·18, and 6·12. The number 72 has many factors:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.

If a·b=m, thenaandbarefactorsofm.
Some numbers, such as 72, have many factors. Other numbers have only two factors. A prime number is a counting
number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.

The counting numbers from 2 to 20 are listed in the table with their factors. Make sure to agree with the “prime” or
“composite” label for each!
The prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Notice that the only even prime number is 2.

the factors to verify your answer.
If we first factored 48 in a different way, for example as 6·8, the result would still be the same. Finish the prime
factorization and verify this for yourself.
TRY IT : :1.3 Find the prime factorization of 80.
TRY IT : :1.4 Find the prime factorization of 60.
HOW TO : :FIND THE PRIME FACTORIZATION OF A COMPOSITE NUMBER.
Step 1. Find two factors whose product is the given number, and use these numbers to create two
branches.
Step 2. If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle the prime, like a leaf on the tree.

Use Variables and Algebraic Symbols
Inalgebra,weusealetterofthealphabettorepresentanumberwhosevaluemaychange.Wecallthisavariableand
letters commonly used for variables are x, y, a, b, c.
Variable
Avariableis a letter that represents a number whose value may change.
A number whose value always remains the same is called aconstant.
Constant
Aconstantis a number whose value always stays the same.
To write algebraically, we need some operation symbols as well as numbers and variables. There are several types of
symbolswewillbeusing.Therearefourbasicarithmeticoperations:addition,subtraction,multiplication,anddivision.
We’ll list the symbols used to indicate these operations below.

Operation Symbols
Operation Notation Say: The result is…
Addition a+b a plus b the sum of a and b
Subtraction a−b a minus b the difference of a and b
Multiplication a·b, ab, (a)(b), a times b the product of a and b
(a)b, a(b)
Division a÷b, a/b, a , ba a divided by the quotient of a and b;
b
b a is called the dividend, and b is called the
divisor
When two quantities have the same value, we say they are equal and connect them with anequalsign.
Equality Symbol
a=b is read “ais equal tob.”
The symbol “=” is called the equal sign.

By not using an equal sign when you simplify an expression, you may avoid confusing expressions with equations.
Simplify an Expression
Tosimplify an expression, do all operations in the expression.
We’veintroducedmostofthesymbolsandnotationusedinalgebra,butnowweneedtoclarifytheorderofoperations.
Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in different values.
For example, consider the expression 4+3·7. Some students simplify this getting 49, by adding 4+3 and then
multiplying that result by 7. Others get 25, by multiplying 3·7 first and then adding 4.
The same expression should give the same result. So mathematicians established some guidelines that are called the
order of operations.

14 Chapter 1 Foundations
HOW TO : :USE THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS.
Step 1. Parentheses and Other Grouping Symbols
◦ Simplifyallexpressionsinsidetheparenthesesorothergroupingsymbols,workingon

Evaluate an Expression
In the last few examples, we simplified expressions using the order of operations. Now we’ll evaluate some
expressions—again following the order of operations. To evaluate an expression means to find the value of the
expression when the variable is replaced by a given number.

Absolute Value
Theabsolute valueof a number is its distance from 0 on the number line.
The absolute value of a number n is written as |n| and |n|≥0 for all numbers.
Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero.
For example,
−5is 5 units away from 0, so|−5|=5.
5 is 5 units away from 0, so|5|=5.
Figure 1.4illustrates this idea.
Figure 1.4 The numbers 5 and −5 are 5 units
away from 0.
Theabsolutevalueofanumberisnevernegativebecausedistancecannotbenegative.Theonlynumberwithabsolute
value equal to zero is the number zero itself because the distance from 0 to 0 on the number line is zero units.

Most students are comfortable with the addition and subtraction facts for positive numbers. But doing addition or
subtraction with both positive and negative numbers may be more challenging.

We let one color (blue) represent positive. The other color (red) will represent the negatives.
Ifwehaveonepositivecounterandonenegativecounter,thevalueofthepairiszero.Theyformaneutralpair.Thevalue
of this neutral pair is zero.
We will use the counters to show how to add:
5+3 −5+(−3) −5+3 5+(−3)
The first example, 5+3, adds 5 positives and 3 positives—both positives.

The second example, −5+(−3), adds 5 negatives and 3 negatives—both negatives.

So what happens when the signs are different? Let’s add −5+3 and 5+(−3).
When we use counters to model addition of positive and negative integers, it is easy to see whether there are more
positive or more negative counters. So we know whether the sum will be positive or negative.
EXAMPLE 1.14
Add:ⓐ −1+(−4) ⓑ −1+5 ⓒ 1+(−5).
Solution
ⓐ
1 negative plus 4 negatives is 5 negatives
ⓑ
There are more positives, so the sum is positive.

We will use the counters to show to subtract:

The first example, 5−3, we subtract 3 positives from 5 positives and end up with 2 positives.
In the second example, −5−(−3), we subtract 3 negatives from 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives.
Each example used counters of only one color, and the “take away” model of subtraction was easy to apply.

Notice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the
signs are thesame, the product ispositive.

some examples of multiplying integers, you might figure out the rules for dividing integers.
5·3=15 so 15÷3=5 −5(3)=−15 so −15÷3=−5
(−5)(−3)=15 so 15÷(−3)=−5 5(−3)=−15 so −15÷(−3)=5
Division follows the same rules as multiplication with regard to signs.
Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers
For multiplication and division of two signed numbers:
Same signs Result
• Two positives Positive
• Two negatives Positive
If the signs are the same, the result is positive.
Different signs Result
• Positive and negative Negative
• Negative and positive Negative

34 Chapter 1 Foundations
If the signs are different, the result is negative.

HOW TO : :SIMPLIFY A FRACTION.
Step 1. Rewrite the numerator and denominator to show the common factors.
If needed, factor the numerator and denominator into prime numbers first.
Step 2. Simplify using the Equivalent Fractions Property by dividing out common factors.
Step 3. Multiply any remaining factors.
Multiply and Divide Fractions
Many people find multiplying and dividing fractions easier than adding and subtracting fractions.
To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
When multiplying fractions, the properties of positive and negative numbers still apply, of course. It is a good idea to
determine the sign of the product as the first step. In Example 1.25, we will multiply a negative by a negative, so the
product will be positive.

Add and Subtract Fractions
Whenwemultipliedfractions,wejustmultipliedthenumeratorsandmultipliedthedenominatorsrightstraightacross.
To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.
Fraction Addition and Subtraction
Ifa,b, andcare numbers where c≠0, then

c c c c c c
To add or subtract fractions, add or subtract the numerators and place the result over the common denominator.
The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the smallest number that can be used as a common
denominator of the fractions. The LCD of the two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators.

Irrational Number
Anirrational numberis a number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers.
Its decimal form does not stop and does not repeat.
Let’s summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is rational or irrational.
Rational or Irrational
If the decimal form of a number
• repeats or stops, the number is arational number.
• does not repeat and does not stop, the number is anirrational number.
Wehaveseenthatallcountingnumbersarewholenumbers,allwholenumbersareintegers,andallintegersarerational
numbers. The irrational numbers are numbers whose decimal form does not stop and does not repeat. When we put
together the rational numbers and the irrational numbers, we get the set ofreal numbers.

1.5 Properties of Real Numbers
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Use the commutative and associative properties
Use the properties of identity, inverse, and zero
Simplify expressions using the Distributive Property
BE PREPARED : :1.5
A more thorough introduction to the topics covered in this section can be found in the Elementary Algebra 2e
chapter, Foundations.
Use the Commutative and Associative Properties
Theorderweaddtwonumbersdoesn’taffecttheresult.Ifweadd 8+9 or 9+8, theresultsarethesame—theyboth
equal 17. So, 8+9=9+8. The order in which we add does not matter!
Similarly,whenmultiplyingtwonumbers,theorderdoesnotaffecttheresult.Ifwemultiply 9·8 or 8·9 theresultsare
the same—they both equal 72. So, 9·8=8·9. The order in which we multiply does not matter!
These examples illustrate theCommutative Property.
Commutative Property
of Addition Ifaandbare real numbers, then a+b=b+a.
of Multiplication Ifaandbare real numbers, then a·b=b·a.
When adding or multiplying, changing theordergives the same result.
The Commutative Property has to do with order. We subtract 9−8 and 8−9, and see that 9−8≠8−9. Since
changing the order of the subtraction does not give the same result, we know thatsubtraction is not commutative.
Divisionisnotcommutativeeither.Since 12÷3≠3÷12, changingtheorderofthedivisiondidnotgivethesameresult.
The commutative properties apply only to addition and multiplication!
Addition and multiplicationarecommutative.
Subtraction and division arenotcommutative.
When adding three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result. For example,
(7+8)+2=7+(8+2), since each side of the equation equals 17.
⎛ 1⎞ ⎛1 ⎞
This is true for multiplication, too. For example, 5· ·3=5· ·3 , since each side of the equation equals 5.
⎝ 3⎠ ⎝3 ⎠
These examples illustrate theAssociative Property.
Associative Property
of Addition Ifa, b, andcare real numbers, then (a+b)+c=a+(b+c).
of Multiplication Ifa, b, andcare real numbers, then (a·b)·c=a·(b·c).
When adding or multiplying, changing thegroupinggives the same result.
TheAssociativePropertyhastodowithgrouping.Ifwechangehowthenumbersaregrouped,theresultwillbethesame.
Notice it is the same three numbers in the same order—the only difference is the grouping.
We saw that subtraction and division were not commutative. They are not associative either.

identity. TheIdentity Property of Additionthat states that for any real number a, a+0=a and 0+a=a.
What happens when we multiply any number by one? Multiplying by 1 doesn’t change the value. So we call 1 the
multiplicativeidentity.TheIdentityPropertyofMultiplicationthatstatesthatforanyrealnumber a, a·1=a and
1·a=a.
We summarize the Identity Properties here.

What number added to 5 gives the additive identity, 0? We know
The missing number was the opposite of the number!
Wecall −a the additive inverse of a. The opposite of anumber isitsadditive inverse.Anumber andits opposite add
to zero, which is the additive identity. This leads to the Inverse Property of Addition that states for any real number
a, a+(−a)=0.

when we talk about vehicles in everyday English.
Step 3. Namewhat we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
• Complete the chart
• Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.
We are looking for the speed of the bikers. Let’s let r represent Wayne’s speed. Since Dennis’ speed is 7 mph
faster, we represent that as r+7
r+7 = Dennis’ speed
r = Wayne’s speed
Fill in the speeds into the chart.
• Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.
Step 4. Translateinto an equation.
• Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
• Then, translate the sentence into an equation.
Theequationtomodelthissituationwillcomefromtherelationbetweenthedistances.Lookatthediagramwe

Since both bikers leave from Riverside and travel to the beach, they travel the same distance. So we write:
Step 5. Solvethe equation using algebra techniques.
Now solve this equation.
So Wayne’s speed is 21 mph.
Find Dennis’ speed.
Dennis’ speed 28 mph.
Step 6. Checkthe answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Dennis 28mph(1.5hours)=42miles
Wayne 21mph(2hours)=42miles✓

miles per hour faster, we will call that speed r+3. We write the speeds in the chart.
The speed is in miles per hour, so we need to express the times in hours, too, in order for the units to be the same.
Remember, 1 hour is 60 minutes. So:
30 1
30 minutes is or hour
60 2

We write the times in the chart.
Next, we multiply rate times time to fill in the distance column.

Solve Linear Inequalities
A linear inequality is much like a linear equation—but the equal sign is replaced with an inequality sign. A linear

174 Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations
inequality is an inequality in one variable that can be written in one of the forms, ax+b<c, ax+b≤c,
ax+b>c, or ax+b≥c.

sides and still keep the equality. Similar properties hold true for inequalities.
We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality. For example:
Notice that the inequality sign stayed the same.
This leads us to the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality.
Addition and Subtraction Property of Inequality
For any numbersa,b, andc,if a<b, then
a+c<b+c a−c<b−c
a+c>b+c a−c>b−c
We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality.
What happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides by a constant?
Let’s first multiply and divide both sides by a positive number.
The inequality signs stayed the same.
Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply by a negative number?
Notice that when we filled in the inequality signs, the inequality signs reversed their direction.
Whenwedivideormultiplyaninequalitybyapositivenumber,theinequalitysignstaysthesame.Whenwedivideor
multiply an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses.
This gives us the Multiplication and Division Property of Inequality.

When we divide or multiply an inequality bya:
• positive number, the inequality stays the same.
• negative number, the inequality reverses.
Sometimes when solving an inequality, as in the next example, the variable ends upon the right. We can rewrite the
inequality in reverse to get the variable to the left.

Solve Applications with Linear Inequalities
Many real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. The method we will use to solve applications with linear
inequalities is very much like the one we used when we solved applications with equations.

each, including tax and delivery. What is the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy?

182 Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations
Solution
Step 1. Readthe problem.
Step 2. Identifywhat you are looking for. the maximum number of
tablets Dawn can buy
Step 3. Namewhat you are looking for.
Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Letn=the number of tablets.
Step 4. Translate. Write a sentence that gives the information to find it. $254.12 times the number of
tablets is no more than
$4,000.
Translate into an inequality. 254.12n≤4000
Step 5. Solvethe inequality.
n≤15.74
Butnmust be a whole number of tablets, so round to 15.
n≤15
Step 6. Checkthe answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Rounding down the price to $250, 15 tablets would cost $3,750, while 16
tablets would be $4,000. So a maximum of 15 tablets at $254.12 seems
reasonable.
Step 7. Answerthe question with a complete sentence. Dawn can buy a maximum of
15 tablets.

Solution
Step 1. Readthe problem.
Step 2. Identifywhat you are looking for. the number of invitations Felicity needs to write
Step 3. Namewhat you are looking for. Let j=the number of invitations.
Choose a variable to represent it.
Step 4. Translate.Write a sentence that gives the $2.50 times the number of invitations minus $650
information to find it. is at least $2,800.
Translate into an inequality. 2.50j−650≥2,800
Step 5. Solvethe inequality. 2.5j≥3,450
j≥1,380invitations
Step 6. Checkthe answer in the problem and make
sure it makes sense.
If Felicity wrote 1400 invitations, her profit would be
2.50(1400) − 650, or $2,850. This is more than $2800.
Step 7. Writea sentence that answers the question. Felicity must write at least 1,380 invitations.

Compound Inequality
Acompound inequalityis made up of two inequalities connected by the word “and” or the word “or.”
To solve a compound inequality means to find all values of the variable that make the compound inequality a true
statement.Wesolvecompoundinequalitiesusingthesametechniquesweusedtosolvelinearinequalities.Wesolveeach
inequality separately and then consider the two solutions.

A double inequality is a compound inequality such as a< x<b. It is equivalent to a< x and x<b.
a< x<b is equivalent to a< x and x<b
a≤ x≤b is equivalent to a≤ x and x≤b
Other forms:
a> x>b is equivalent to a> x and x>b
a≥ x≥b is equivalent to a≥ x and x≥b

Solve Absolute Value Equations
As we prepare to solve absolute value equations, we review our definition ofabsolute value.
Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line.
The absolute value of a numbernis written as |n| and |n|≥0 for all numbers.
Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero.
Welearnedthatbothanumberanditsoppositearethesamedistancefromzeroonthenumberline.Sincetheyhavethe
same distance from zero, they have the same absolute value. For example:
−5 is 5 units away from 0, so |−5|=5.
5 is 5 units away from 0, so |5|=5.
Figure 2.6illustrates this idea.
Figure 2.6 The numbers 5 and −5 are both five
units away from zero.

If |x|=5
then x=−5 or x=5
Thesolutioncanbesimplifiedtoasinglestatementbywriting x=±5. Thisisread,“xisequaltopositiveornegative5”.
We can generalize this to the following property for absolute value equations.
Absolute Value Equations
For any algebraic expression,u, and any positive real number,a,
if |u|=a
then u=−a or u=a
Remember that an absolute value cannot be a negative number.
EXAMPLE 2.68

Solution
ⓐ
|x|=8
Write the equivalent equations. x=−8or x=8
x=±8
ⓑ
|y|=−6
No solution
Since an absolute value is always positive, there are no solutions to this equation.
ⓒ
|z|=0
Write the equivalent equations. z=−0orz=0
Since −0 = 0, z=0
Both equations tell us thatz= 0 and so there is only one solution.

Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables,xandy.
Theequation y=−3x+5 isalsoalinearequation.Butitdoesnotappeartobeintheform Ax+By=C. Wecanuse
the Addition Property of Equality and rewrite it in Ax+By=C form.
y = −3x+5
Add to both sides. y+3x = −3x+5+3x
Simplify. y+3x = 5
Use the Commutative Property to put it in
Ax+By=Cform. 3x+y = 5
By rewriting y=−3x+5 as 3x+y=5, we can easily see that it is a linear equation in two variables because it is

A linear equation is instandard formwhen it is written Ax+By=C.

Intercepts of a Line
The points where a line crosses thex-axis and they-axis are called theintercepts of the line.
Let’s look at the graphs of the lines.
First, notice where each of these lines crosses thex-axis. SeeTable 3.4.
Now, let’s look at the points where these lines cross they-axis.

Whilewecouldplotpoints,usetheslope–interceptform,orfindtheinterceptsforanyequation,ifwerecognizethemost
convenient way to graph a certain type of equation, our work will be easier.
Generally,plottingpointsisnotthemostefficientwaytographaline.Let’slookforsomepatternstohelpdeterminethe
most convenient method to graph a line.
Here are five equations we graphed in this chapter, and the method we used to graph each of them.
Equation Method
#1 x=2 Vertical line
#2 y=−1 Horizontal line
#3 −x+2y=6 Intercepts
#4 4x−3y=12 Intercepts
#5 y=−x+4 Slope–intercept
Equations#1and#2eachhavejustonevariable.Remember,inequationsofthisformthevalueofthatonevariableis
constant;itdoesnotdependonthevalueoftheothervariable.Equationsofthisformhavegraphsthatareverticalor
horizontal lines.
In equations #3 and #4, both x and y are on the same side of the equation. These two equations are of the form
Ax+By=C. Wesubstituted y=0 tofindthex-interceptand x=0 tofindthey-intercept,andthenfoundathird
point by choosing another value forxory.
Equation#5iswritteninslope–interceptform.Afteridentifyingtheslopeandy-interceptfromtheequationweusedthem
to graph the line.
This leads to the following strategy.
Strategy for Choosing the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line
Consider the form of the equation.
• If it only has one variable, it is a vertical or horizontal line.
◦ x=a is a vertical line passing through thex-axis ata.
◦ y=b is a horizontal line passing through they-axis atb.
• Ifyisisolatedononesideoftheequation,intheform y=mx+b, graphbyusingtheslopeandy-intercept.
◦ Identify the slope andy-intercept and then graph.
• If the equation is of the form Ax+By=C, find the intercepts.
◦ Find thex- andy-intercepts, a third point, and then graph.

Sincethehorizontallinescrossthey-axisat y=−4 andat y=3, weknowthey-interceptsare (0, −4) and (0, 3).
The lines have the same slope and differenty-intercepts and so they are parallel.

We recognize right away from the equations that these are vertical lines, and so we know their slopes are undefined.
Since the vertical lines cross thex-axis at x=−2 and x=−5, we know they-intercepts are (−2, 0) and (−5, 0).
The lines are vertical and have differentx-intercepts and so they are parallel.

Solution

The steps we take to graph a linear inequality are summarized here.
HOW TO : :GRAPH A LINEAR INEQUALITY IN TWO VARIABLES.
Step 1. Identify and graph the boundary line.
◦ If the inequality is ≤or≥, the boundary line is solid.
◦ If the inequality is <or>, the boundary line is dashed.
Step 2. Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?
Step 3. Shade in one side of the boundary line.
◦ If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.
◦ If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.
EXAMPLE 3.38
Graph the linear inequality x−2y<5.
Solution
First, we graph the boundary line x−2y=5. The inequality is < so we draw a dashed line.

308 Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions
Then, we test a point. We’ll use (0, 0) again because it is easy to evaluate and it is not on the boundary line.
Is (0, 0) a solution of x−2y<5?
The point (0, 0) is a solution of x−2y<5, so we shade in that side of the boundary line.
All points in the shaded region, but not those on the boundary line, represent the solutions to x−2y<5.
TRY IT : :3.75 Graph the linear inequality: 2x−3y<6.
TRY IT : :3.76 Graph the linear inequality: 2x−y>3.
What if the boundary line goes through the origin? Then, we won’t be able to use (0, 0) as a test point. No
problem—we’ll just choose some other point that is not on the boundary line.

Solution
First,wegraphtheboundaryline y=−4x. Itisinslope–interceptform,with m=−4 and b=0. Theinequalityis ≤
so we draw a solid line.
Now we need a test point. We can see that the point (1, 0) is not on the boundary line.
Is (1, 0) a solution of y≤−4x?
The point (1, 0) is not a solution to y≤ −4x, so we shade in the opposite side of the boundary line.
All points in the shaded region and on the boundary line represent the solutions to y≤ −4x.

Recall that:
x=a vertical line
y=b horizontal line
EXAMPLE 3.40
Graph the linear inequality: y>3.
Solution
First, we graph the boundary line y=3. It is a horizontal line. The inequality is > so we draw a dashed line.
We test the point (0, 0).
y>3
0 > 3
So, (0, 0) is not a solution to y>3.
So we shade the side that does not include (0, 0) as shown in this graph.
All points in the shaded region, but not those on the boundary line, represent the solutions to y>3.

In algebra, more often than not, functions will be represented by an equation. It is easiest to see if the equation is a
function when it is solved fory. If each value ofxresults in only one value ofy, then the equation defines a function.

Solve a System of Equations by Elimination
We have solved systems of linear equations by graphing and by substitution. Graphing works well when the variable
coefficientsaresmallandthesolutionhasintegervalues.Substitutionworkswellwhenwecaneasilysolveoneequation
for one of the variables and not have too many fractions in the resulting expression.
ThethirdmethodofsolvingsystemsoflinearequationsiscalledtheEliminationMethod.Whenwesolvedasystemby
substitution,westartedwithtwoequationsandtwovariablesandreducedittooneequationwithonevariable.Thisis
what we’ll do with the elimination method, too, but we’ll have a different way to get there.
TheEliminationMethodisbasedontheAdditionPropertyofEquality.TheAdditionPropertyofEqualitysaysthatwhen
youaddthesamequantitytobothsidesofanequation,youstillhaveequality.WewillextendtheAdditionPropertyof
Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal.
For any expressionsa, b, c,andd.
if a = b
and c = d
then a+c = b+d.
To solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which
variablewillbeeasiesttoeliminate.Howdowedecide?Wewanttohavethecoefficientsofonevariablebeopposites,so
that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable.
Notice how that works when we add these two equations together:
⎧
3x+y=5
⎨
⎩2x−y=0
—————
5x =5
They’s add to zero and we have one equation with one variable.
Let’s try another one:
⎧ x+4y=2
⎨
⎩2x+5y=−2
This time we don’t see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations.
Butifwemultiplythefirstequationby −2, wewillmakethecoefficientsofxopposites.Wemustmultiplyeverytermon
both sides of the equation by −2.
Then rewrite the system of equations.
Now we see that the coefficients of thexterms are opposites, soxwill be eliminated when we add these two equations.

Once we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of the original

HOW TO : :SOLVE A SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS BY ELIMINATION.
Step 1. Write both equations in standard form. If any coefficients are fractions, clear them.
Step 2. Make the coefficients of one variable opposites.
◦ Decide which variable you will eliminate.
◦ Multiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.
Step 3. Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable.
Step 4. Solve for the remaining variable.
Step 5. SubstitutethesolutionfromStep4intooneoftheoriginalequations.Thensolvefortheother
variable.
Step 6. Write the solution as an ordered pair.
Step 7. Check that the ordered pair is a solution tobothoriginal equations.

Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations 405
Solution
Readthe problem. This is a uniform motion problem and a
picture will help us visualize the situation.
Identifywhat we are looking for. We are looking for the speed of the ship
in still water and the speed of the current.
Namewhat we are looking for. Let s= the rate of the ship in still water.
c= the rate of the current
A chart will help us organize the information.
The ship goes downstream and then upstream.
Going downstream, the current helps the
ship and so the ship's actual rate iss+c.
Going upstream, the current slows the ship
and so the actual rate iss−c.
Downstream it takes 4 hours.
Upstream it takes 5 hours.
Each way the distance is 60 miles.
Translateinto a system of equations.
Since rate times time is distance, we can
write the system of equations.

Checkthe answer in the problem.
The downstream rate would be
13.5+1.5=15 mph.
In 4 hours the ship would travel
15·4=60 miles.
The upstream rate would be
13.5−1.5=12 mph.
In 5 hours the ship would travel
12·5=60 miles.
Answerthe question. The rate of the ship is 13.5 mph and
the rate of the current is 1.5 mph.

Solution
Readthe problem. This is a uniform motion problem and a
picture will help us visualize.
Identifywhat we are looking for. We are looking for the speed of the jet
in still air and the speed of the wind.
Namewhat we are looking for. Let j= the speed of the jet in still air.
w= the speed of the wind.
A chart will help us organize the information.
The jet makes two trips—one in a tailwind
and one in a headwind.
In a tailwind, the wind helps the jet and so
the rate isj+w.
In a headwind, the wind slows the jet and
so the rate isj‒w.
Each trip takes 3 hours.
In a tailwind the jet flies 1,095 miles.
In a headwind the jet flies 987 miles.

To solve a system of three linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to all three
equations.Inotherwords,wearelookingfortheorderedtriple (x, y, z) thatmakesallthreeequationstrue.Theseare
called thesolutions of the system of three linear equations with three variables.
Solutions of a System of Linear Equations with Three Variables
Solutions of a system of equations are the values of the variables that make all the equations true. A solution is
represented by anordered triple (x, y, z).

HOW TO : :SOLVE A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH THREE VARIABLES.
Step 1. Write the equations in standard form
◦ If any coefficients are fractions, clear them.
Step 2. Eliminate the same variable from two equations.
◦ Decide which variable you will eliminate.
◦ Work with a pair of equations to eliminate the chosen variable.
◦ Multiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.
◦ Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable
Step 3. Repeat Step 2 using two other equations and eliminate the same variable as in Step 2.
Step 4. The two new equations form a system of two equations with two variables. Solve this system.
Step 5. Use the values of the two variables found in Step 4 to find the third variable.
Step 6. Write the solution as an ordered triple.
Step 7. Check that the ordered triple is a solution toall threeoriginal equations.
EXAMPLE 4.33
⎧3x−4z=0
Solve: ⎨3y+2z=−3.
⎩
2x+3y=−5
Solution
⎧3x−4z=0 (1)
⎨3y+2z=−3(2)
⎩
2x+3y=−5(3)
We can eliminate z from equations (1) and (2) by multiplying equation (2) by 2 and then adding the resulting equations.
Notice that equations (3) and (4) both have the variables x and y. We will solve this new system for x and y.
To solve fory, we substitute x=−4 into equation (3).

432 Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations
We now have x=−4 and y=1. We need to solve forz. We can substitute x=−4 into equation (1) to findz.
We write the solution as an ordered triple. (−4, 1, −3)
We check that the solution makes all three equations true.
3x−4z = 0(1) 3y+2z = −3(2) 2x+3y = −5(3)
3(−4)−4(−3) = ? 0 3(1)+2(−3) = ? −3 2(−4)+3(1) = ? −5
0 = 0✓ −3 = −3✓ −5 = −5✓
The solution is(−4, 1, −3).

HOW TO : :SOLVE A SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS USING MATRICES.
Step 1. Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations.
Step 2. Using row operations get the entry in row 1, column 1 to be 1.
Step 3. Using row operations, get zeros in column 1 below the 1.
Step 4. Using row operations, get the entry in row 2, column 2 to be 1.
Step 5. Continue the process until the matrix is in row-echelon form.
Step 6. Write the corresponding system of equations.
Step 7. Use substitution to find the remaining variables.
Step 8. Write the solution as an ordered pair or triple.
Step 9. Check that the solution makes the original equations true.
Here is a visual to show the order for getting the 1’s and 0’s in the proper position for row-echelon form.
We use the same procedure when the system of equations has three equations.

Step 1. Graph the first inequality.
◦ Graph the boundary line.
◦ Shade in the side of the boundary line where the inequality is true.
Step 2. On the same grid, graph the second inequality.
◦ Graph the boundary line.
◦ Shade in the side of that boundary line where the inequality is true.
Step 3. The solution is the region where the shading overlaps.
Step 4. Check by choosing a test point.

Polynomials
polynomial—A monomial, or two or more algebraic terms combined by addition or subtraction is a polynomial.
monomial—A polynomial with exactly one term is called a monomial.
binomial—A polynomial with exactly two terms is called a binomial.
trinomial—A polynomial with exactly three terms is called a trinomial.

Add and Subtract Polynomials
We have learned how to simplify expressions by combining like terms. Remember, like terms must have the same
variables with the same exponent. Since monomials are terms, adding and subtracting monomials is the same as
combining like terms. If the monomials are like terms, we just combine them by adding or subtracting the coefficients.
EXAMPLE 5.2
Add or subtract:ⓐ 25y 2 +15y 2 ⓑ 16pq 3 − ⎛ −7pq 3⎞ .

⎝ ⎠
TRY IT : :5.4 Add or subtract:ⓐ −15c 2 +8c 2 ⓑ −15y 2 z 3 − ⎛ −5y 2 z 3⎞ .

Remember that like terms must have the same variables with the same exponents.

Rememberthatanexponentindicatesrepeatedmultiplicationofthesamequantity.Forexample,intheexpression a m ,
theexponent mtells us how many times we use thebase aas a factor.
Let’s review the vocabulary for expressions with exponents.

This is readato the m th power.
In the expression a m , theexponent mtells us how many times we use thebase aas a factor.
Whenwecombineliketermsbyaddingandsubtracting,weneedtohavethesamebasewiththesameexponent.But
when you multiply and divide, the exponents may be different, and sometimes the bases may be different, too.
First, we will look at an example that leads to theProduct Property.

508 Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions
What does this mean?
Notice that 5 is the sum of the exponents, 2 and 3. We see x 2 ·x 3 is x 2+3 or x 5 .
The base stayed the same and we added the exponents. This leads to the Product Property for Exponents.
Product Property for Exponents

If we look at what happened to the decimal point, we can see a method to easily convert from decimal notation to
scientific notation.
In both cases, the decimal was moved 3 places to get the first factor between 1 and 10.
The power of 10 is positive when the number is larger than 1: 4,000=4×10 3
The power of 10 is negative when the number is between 0 and 1: 0.004=4×10 −3
HOW TO : :TO CONVERT A DECIMAL TO SCIENTIFIC NOTATION.
Step 1. Move the decimal point so that the first factor is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10.
Step 2. Count the number of decimal places,n, that the decimal point was moved.
Step 3. Write the number as a product with a power of 10. If the original number is.
◦ greater than 1, the power of 10 will be 10 n .
◦ between 0 and 1, the power of 10 will be 10 −n .
Step 4. Check.

for what is called synthetic division. The same problem in the synthetic division format is shown next.
Synthetic division basically just removes unnecessary repeated variables and numbers. Here all the x and x 2 are
removed. as well as the −x 2 and −4x as they are opposite the term above.
The first row of the synthetic division is the coefficients of the dividend. The −5 is the opposite of the 5 in the divisor.
The second row of the synthetic division are the numbers shown in red in the division problem.
The third row of the synthetic division are the numbers shown in blue in the division problem.
Notice the quotient and remainder are shown in the third row.
Synthetic division only works when the divisor is of the formx−c.
The following example will explain the process.

Solution
Write the dividend with decreasing powers of x.
Write the coefficients of the terms as the first
row of the synthetic division.
Write the divisor as x−c and placec
in the synthetic division in the divisor box.
Bring down the first coefficient to the third row.
Multiply that coefficient by the divisor and place the
result in the second row under the second coefficient.
Add the second column, putting the result in the third row.
Multiply that result by the divisor and place the

Add the final column, putting the result in the third row.
The quotient is 2x 2 −1x+3 and the remainder is 2.
The division is complete. The numbers in the third row give us the result. The 2 −1 3 are the coefficients of the

If we evaluate this at c, we get:
This leads us to the Remainder Theorem.
Remainder Theorem
If the polynomial function f(x) is divided by x−c, then the remainder is f(c).
EXAMPLE 5.45
Use the Remainder Theorem to find the remainder when f(x)= x 3 +3x+19 is divided by x+2.
Solution
TousetheRemainderTheorem,wemustusethedivisorinthe x−c form.Wecanwritethedivisor x+2 as x−(−2).
So, our c is −2.
To find the remainder, we evaluate f(c) which is f(−2).
To evaluate f(−2), substitute
x=−2.
Simplify.
The remainder is 5 when f(x)= x 3 +3x+19 is divided by
x+2.
Check:
Use synthetic division to check.
The remainder is 5.

Use the Remainder Theorem to find the remainder when f(x)= x 3 −7x+12 is divided by x+3.

4a 2 −6a+9 by 2a+3 to get 8a 3 +27.
⎛ 4a 2 −6a+9 ⎞ (2a+3)=8a 3 +27
⎝ ⎠
Written this way, we can see that 4a 2 −6a+9 and 2a+3 are factors of 8a 3 +27. When we did the division, the
remainder was zero.
Wheneveradivisor, x−c, dividesapolynomialfunction, f(x), andresultinginaremainderofzero,wesay x−c isa
factor of f(x).
The reverse is also true. If x−c is a factor of f(x) then x−c will divide the polynomial function resulting in a
remainder of zero.
We will state this in the Factor Theorem.
Factor Theorem
For any polynomial function f(x),
• if x−c is a factor of f(x), then f(c)=0
• if f(c)=0, then x−c is a factor of f(x)
EXAMPLE 5.46
Use the Remainder Theorem to determine if x−4 is a factor of f(x)= x 3 −64.
Solution
The Factor Theorem tells us that x−4 is a factor of f(x)= x 3 −64 if f(4)=0.

factors.
Step 3. Bring down the common factors that all expressions share.
Step 4. Multiply the factors.
The next example will show us the steps to find the greatest common factor of three expressions.
EXAMPLE 6.1

Factor by Grouping
Sometimes there is no common factor of all the terms of a polynomial. When there are four terms we separate the
polynomial into two parts with two terms in each part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial can be
factored, you will find a common factor emerges from both parts. Not all polynomials can be factored. Just like some
numbers areprime, some polynomials are prime.

Step 3. Find all the factor pairs of the first term.
Step 4. Find all the factor pairs of the third term.
Step 5. Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found.
Step 6. Check by multiplying.
Remember, when the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomials must both be
negative.

Solution
The trinomial is already in descending order.
Find the factors of the first term.
Find the factors of the last term. Consider the signs.
Since the last term, 5, is positive its factors must both be
positive or both be negative. The coefficient of the
middle term is negative, so we use the negative factors.

Sometimes a trinomial does not appear to be in the ax 2 +bx+c form. However, we can often make a thoughtful
substitutionthatwillallowustomakeitfitthe ax 2 +bx+c form.Thisiscalledfactoringbysubstitution.Itisstandard
to useufor the substitution.

this relationship as you try to find a substitution.
EXAMPLE 6.21
Factor by substitution: x 4 −4x 2 −5.
Solution
The variable part of the middle term is x 2 and its square, x 4 , is the variable part of the first term. (We know
2
⎛ x 2⎞ = x 4 ). If we let u= x 2 , we can put our trinomial in the ax 2 +bx+c form we need to factor it.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Recognize and use the appropriate method to factor a polynomial completely
Recognize and Use the Appropriate Method to Factor a Polynomial Completely
You have now become acquainted with all the methods of factoring that you will need in this course. The following
chart summarizes all the factoring methods we have covered, and outlines a strategy you should use when factoring
polynomials.
General Strategy for Factoring Polynomials
HOW TO : :USE A GENERAL STRATEGY FOR FACTORING POLYNOMIALS.
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor?
Factor it out.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
If it is a binomial:
◦ Is it a sum?
Of squares? Sums of squares do not factor.
Of cubes? Use the sum of cubes pattern.
◦ Is it a difference?
Of squares? Factor as the product of conjugates.
Of cubes? Use the difference of cubes pattern.
If it is a trinomial:
◦ Is it of the form x 2 +bx+c? Undo FOIL.
◦ Is it of the form ax 2 +bx+c?
Ifaandcare squares, check if it fits the trinomial square pattern.
Use the trial and error or “ac” method.
If it has more than three terms:
◦ Use the grouping method.
Step 3. Check.
Is it factored completely?
Do the factors multiply back to the original polynomial?
Remember, a polynomial is completely factored if, other than monomials, its factors areprime!

The ball will be at 80 feet the moment Dennis tosses the ball and then 4
seconds later, when the ball is falling.
ⓒTo find the height ball at t=2 seconds we find h(2).
h(t)=−16t 2 +64t+80
To find h(2) substitute 2 for t. h(2)=−16(2)2 +64·2+80
Simplify. h(2)=144
After 2 seconds, the ball will be at 144 feet.

multiply, divide and use them in applications.

Simplify Rational Expressions
A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.
Similarly, asimplified rational expressionhas no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.

656 Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions
Simplified Rational Expression
A rational expression is considered simplified if there are no common factors in its numerator and denominator.
For example,
x+2
is simplified because there are no common factors of x+2andx+3.
x+3
2x
is not simplified becausexis a common factor of2xand3x.

Multiply Rational Expressions
To multiply rational expressions, we do just what we did with numerical fractions. We multiply the numerators and
multiply the denominators. Then, if there are any common factors, we remove them to simplify the result.

To divide rational expressions, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.
Once we rewrite the division as multiplication of the first expression by the reciprocal of the second, we then factor
everything and look for common factors.

Add and Subtract Rational Expressions with a Common Denominator
What is the first step you take when you add numerical fractions? You check if they have a common denominator. If
they do, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. If they do not have a common
denominator, you find one before you add.
Itisthesamewithrationalexpressions.Toaddrationalexpressions,theymusthaveacommondenominator.Whenthe
denominators are the same, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator.

Solve a Rational Equation for a Specific Variable
When we solved linear equations, we learned how to solve a formula for a specific variable. Many formulas used
in business, science, economics, and other fields use rational equations to model the relation between two or more
variables. We will now see how to solve a rational equation for a specific variable.
When we developed the point-slope formula from our slope formula, we cleared the fractions by multiplying by the LCD.

Solution
This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation.
We fill in the chart to organize the information.
We are looking for the speed of the airplane. Letr= the speed of the airplane.
When the plane flies with the wind,
the wind increases its speed and so the rate isr+ 30.
When the plane flies against the wind,
the wind decreases its speed and the rate isr− 30.
Write in the rates.
Write in the distances.
Since D=r·t, we solve for t and get t= D .
r
We divide the distance by the rate in each row, and
place the expression in the time column.
We know the times are equal and so we write 200 300

the left or right of it. The numbers to the right of 3 are larger than 3, so we shade to the right.
To solve a rational inequality, we first must write the inequality with only one quotient on the left and 0 on the right.
Nextwedeterminethecriticalpointstousetodividethenumberlineintointervals.Acriticalpointisanumberwhich
make the rational expression zero or undefined.
We then will evaluate the factors of the numerator and denominator, and find the quotient in each interval. This will
identify the interval, or intervals, that contains all the solutions of the rational inequality.
We write the solution in interval notation being careful to determine whether the endpoints are included.

Step 1.Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zero on the right.

Our inequality is in this form. ≥0

Step 2.Determine the critical points—the points where the rational expression will be zero or undefined.
Therationalexpressionwillbezerowhenthenumeratoriszero.Since x−1=0 when x=1, then 1 isacriticalpoint.
Therationalexpressionwillbeundefinedwhenthedenominatoriszero.Since x+3=0 when x=−3, then −3 isa
critical point.
The critical points are 1 and −3.
Step 3.Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals.
The number line is divided into three intervals:

The number −4 is in the interval (−∞, −3). Test x=−4 in the expression in the numerator and the denominator.
Above the number line, mark the factor x−1 negative and mark the factor x+3 negative.
Since a negative divided by a negative is positive, mark the quotient positive in the interval (−∞, −3).
Interval⎛ ⎝−3, 1⎞ ⎠
The number 0 is in the interval (−3, 1). Test x=0.
Above the number line, mark the factor x−1 negative and mark x+3 positive.

Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions 737
Since a negative divided by a positive is negative, the quotient is marked negative in the interval (−3, 1).
Interval⎛ ⎝1, ∞⎞ ⎠
The number 2 is in the interval (1, ∞). Test x=2.
Above the number line, mark the factor x−1 positive and mark x+3 positive.
Since a positive divided by a positive is positive, mark the quotient positive in the interval (1, ∞).
Step 5.Determine the intervals where the inequality is correct. Write the solution in interval notation.

parenthesis.

HOW TO : :SOLVE A RATIONAL INEQUALITY.
Step 1. Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zero on the right.
Step 2. Determine the critical points–the points where the rational expression will be zero or
undefined.
Step 3. Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals.
Step 4. Test a value in each interval. Above the number line show the sign of each factor of the
numerator and denominator in each interval. Below the number line show the sign of the
quotient.
Step 5. Determine the intervals where the inequality is correct. Write the solution in interval notation.
The next example requires that we first get the rational inequality into the correct form.

Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions 739
Above the number line show the sign of each factor of the rational expression in each interval.
Below the number line show the sign of the quotient.
Determine the intervals where the inequality is correct. We want the quotient to be negative, so the
solution includes the points between −2 and 6. Since the inequality is strictly less than, the endpoints are
not included.
We write the solution in interval notation as (−2, 6).

So far we have only talked about squares and square roots. Let’s now extend our work to include higher powers and
higher roots.
Let’s review some vocabulary first.

760 Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals
We write: We say:
2
n nsquared
3
n ncubed
4
n nto the fourth power
5
n nto the fifth power
The terms ‘squared’ and ‘cubed’ come from the formulas for area of a square and volume of a cube.
It will be helpful to have a table of the powers of the integers from −5 to 5. SeeFigure 8.2.
Figure 8.2

nis called theindexof the radical.
Just like we use the word ‘cubed’ forb3, we use the term ‘cube root’ for 3 a.
We can refer toFigure 8.2to help find higher roots.

Could we have an even root of a negative number? We know that the square root of a negative number is not a real
number.Thesameistrueforanyevenroot.Evenrootsofnegativenumbersarenotrealnumbers.Oddrootsofnegative

n
• a≥0, then a is a real number.

• a<0, then a is not a real number.
n
Whennis an odd number, a is a real number for all values ofa.
We will apply these properties in the next two examples.

But what about an even root? We want the principal root, so 625=5.
But notice,
Howcanwemakesurethefourthrootof−5raisedtothefourthpoweris5?Wecanusetheabsolutevalue. |−5|=5. So
we say that whennis even n a n =|a|. This guarantees the principal root is positive.
Simplifying Odd and Even Roots
For any integer n≥2,
n n
when the indexnis odd a =a
n n
when the indexnis even a =|a|
We must use theabsolute valuesigns when we take an even root of an expression with a variable in the radical.

Since(a m)2 =a 2m . (a m)2
Sincenis even n a n =|a|. |a m|
So a 2m =|a m|.

If you missed this problem, reviewExample 5.17.
Use the Product Property to Simplify Radical Expressions
We will simplify radical expressions in a way similar to how we simplified fractions. A fraction is simplified if there are
no common factors in the numerator anddenominator. To simplify afraction, we look for any common factors in the
numerator and denominator.
Aradicalexpression, n a, isconsideredsimplifiedifithasnofactorsof m n . So,tosimplifyaradicalexpression,welook
for any factors in the radicand that are powers of the index.
Simplified Radical Expression
For real numbersaandm, and n≥2,
n n
ais considered simplified ifahas no factors ofm
For example, 5 is considered simplified because there are no perfect square factors in 5. But 12 is not simplified
because 12 has a perfect square factor of 4.
3 3
Similarly, 4 is simplified because there are no perfect cube factors in 4. But 24 is not simplified because 24 has a
perfect cube factor of 8.
Tosimplifyradicalexpressions,wewillalsousesomepropertiesofroots.Thepropertieswewillusetosimplifyradical
expressions are similar to the properties of exponents. We know that (ab) n =a n b n . The corresponding of Product
n n n
Property of Rootssays that ab= a· b.
Product Property ofnthRoots
n n
If a and b are real numbers, and n≥2 is an integer, then
n n n n n n
ab= a· b and a· b= ab
We use the Product Property of Roots to remove all perfect square factors from a square root.

Rationalize a One Term Denominator
Before the calculator became a tool of everyday life, approximating the value of a fraction with a radical in the
denominator was a very cumbersome process!
For this reason, a process called rationalizing the denominator was developed. A fraction with a radical in the
denominatorisconvertedtoanequivalentfractionwhosedenominatorisaninteger.Squarerootsofnumbersthatare
notperfectsquaresareirrationalnumbers.Whenwerationalizethedenominator,wewriteanequivalentfractionwitha
rational number in the denominator.
This process is still used today, and is useful in other areas of mathematics, too.
Rationalizing the Denominator
Rationalizing the denominator is the process of converting a fraction with a radical in the denominator to an
equivalent fraction whose denominator is an integer.
Eventhoughwehavecalculatorsavailablenearlyeverywhere,afractionwitharadicalinthedenominatorstillmustbe
rationalized. It is not considered simplified if the denominator contains a radical.
Similarly, aradical expressionis not considered simplified if the radicand contains a fraction.
Simplified Radical Expressions
A radical expression is considered simplified if there are
• no factors in the radicand have perfect powers of the index
• no fractions in the radicand
• no radicals in the denominator of a fraction
Torationalizeadenominatorwithasquareroot,weusethepropertythat ( a)2 =a. Ifwesquareanirrationalsquare
root, we get a rational number.
We will use this property to rationalize the denominator in the next example.

Evaluate a Radical Function
Inthissection wewill extend ourprevious workwithfunctions toinclude radicals. Ifafunction isdefined byaradical
expression, we call it aradical function.
The square root function is f(x)= x.

The cube root function is f(x)= x.
Radical Function
Aradical functionis a function that is defined by a radical expression.
To evaluate a radical function, we find the value of f(x) for a given value of x just as we did in our previous work with
functions.
EXAMPLE 8.68
For the function f(x)= 2x−1, findⓐ f(5) ⓑ f(−2).
Solution
ⓐ
f(x)= 2x−1
To evaluate f(5), substitute 5 for x. f(5)= 2·5−1
Simplify. f(5)= 9
Take the square root. f(5)=3

If b=0, then a+bi becomes a+0·i=a, and is a real number.
If b≠0, then a+bi is an imaginary number.

Complex Conjugate Pair
Acomplex conjugate pairis of the form a+bi, a−bi.
We will multiply a complex conjugate pair in the next example.
EXAMPLE 8.84
Multiply: (3−2i)(3+2i).

Fromourstudyofpolynomials,weknowtheproductofconjugatesisalwaysoftheform (a−b)(a+b)=a 2 −b 2 . The
result is called adifference of squares. We can multiply a complex conjugate pair using this pattern.
The last example we used FOIL. Now we will use theProduct of Conjugates Pattern.
Notice this is the same result we found inExample 8.84.
When we multiply complex conjugates, the product of the last terms will always have an i 2 which simplifies to −1.

Binomial Squares Pattern
Ifaandbare real numbers,
We can use this pattern to “make” a perfect square.

What number,b,when multiplied with 2xgives 6x? It would have to be 3, which is (6). Sob= 3.
2
Now to complete the perfect square trinomial, we will find the last term by squaringb, which is 32= 9.
We can now factor.
So we found that adding 9 tox2+ 6x‘completes the square’, and we write it as (x+ 3)2.

Area of a Triangle
1
For a triangle with base,b, and height,h, the area,A, is given by the formula A= bh.
2
Recall that when we solve geometric applications, it is helpful to draw the figure.
EXAMPLE 9.36

Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for. We are looking for the base and height.
Step 3. Namewhat we are looking for. Leth= the height of the triangle.
2h+ 4 = the base of the triangle
Step 4. Translateinto an equation. 1

Step 5. Solvethe equation. 1
120= (2h+4)h
Substitute in the values. 2
Distribute. 2
120=h +2h
This is a quadratic equation, rewrite it in 2
h +2h−120=0
standard form.
Factor. (h−10)(h+12)=0
Use the Zero Product Property. h−10=0 h+12=0
Simplify. h=10, h= −12
Sincehis the height of a window, a value ofh= −12 does not make sense.

the round trip was 9 hours. If the plane was flying at a rate of 450 miles per hour, what was the speed of the jet stream?
Solution
This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation.

942 Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions
We fill in the chart to organize the information.
We are looking for the speed of the jet stream. Let r = the speed of the jet stream.
When the plane flies with the wind, the wind increases its speed and so the rate is 450 +r.
When the plane flies against the wind, the wind decreases its speed and the rate is 450 −r.
Write in the rates.
Write in the distances.
Since D=r·t, we solve for
t and get t= D.
r
We divide the distance by
the rate in each row, and
place the expression in the
time column.
We know the times add to 9 2000 2000
+ =9
and so we write our equation. 450−r 450+r
We multiply both sides by the LCD.
(450−r)(450+r)
⎛ 2000

Factor the 2,000. 2000(450+r+450−r)= 9 ⎛ 450 2 −r 2⎞
⎝ ⎠
Solve. 2000(900)= 9 ⎛ 450 2 −r 2⎞

Find the Intercepts of a Parabola
When we graphed linear equations, we often used the x- and y-intercepts to help us graph the lines. Finding the
coordinates of the intercepts will help us to graph parabolas, too.
Remember, at they-intercept the value ofxis zero. So to find they-intercept, we substitutex= 0 into the function.
Let’s find they-intercepts of the two parabolas shown inFigure 9.4.

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions 987
Solution
Since it is quadratic, we start with the f(x)=a(x−h)2 +kform.
The vertex, (h, k), is (−2, −1) so h=−2 and k=−1. f(x)=a(x−(−2))2 −1
To find a, we use the y-intercept, (0, 7).

In this chapter, we will introduce two new types of functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions. These

Wehaveactuallyusedcompositionwithoutusingthenotationmanytimesbefore.Whenwegraphedquadraticfunctions

shifted it down vertically four units, we were using the composition defined by ⎛f∘g⎞(x)= f⎛g(x)⎞ where f(x)= x−4.

The next example will demonstrate that ⎛f∘g⎞(x), ⎛g∘f⎞(x) and ⎛f ·g⎞(x) usually result in different outputs.

Find the Inverse of a Function
Let’s look at a one-to one function, f , represented by the ordered pairs {(0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8)}. For each x
-value, f adds5togetthe y-value.To‘undo’theadditionof5,wesubtract5fromeach y-valueandgetbacktothe

Noticethatthattheorderedpairsof f and f −1 havetheir x-valuesand y-valuesreversed.Thedomainof f isthe
range of f −1 and the domain of f −1 is the range of f.
Inverse of a Function Defined by Ordered Pairs
If f(x) isaone-to-onefunctionwhoseorderedpairsareoftheform (x, y), thenitsinversefunction f −1(x) isthe
set of ordered pairs (y, x).
In the next example we will find the inverse of a function defined by ordered pairs.

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions 1023
Solution
This function is one-to-one since every x-value is paired with exactly one y-value.
To find the inverse we reverse the x-values and y-values in the ordered pairs of the function.

Solution
We can use points on the graph to find points on the inverse graph. Some points on the graph are:
(−5, −3), (−3, −1), (−1, 0), (0, 2), (3, 4).
So, the inverse function will contain the points: (−3, −5), (−1, −3), (0, −1), (2, 0), (4, 3).

from what we have studied so far. These models involve exponential functions.
Anexponential functionis a function of the form f(x)=a x where a>0 and a≠1.
Exponential Function
An exponential function, where a>0 and a≠1, is a function of the form
f(x)=a x
Notice that in this function, the variable is the exponent. In our functions so far, the variables were the base.
Ourdefinitionsays a≠1. Ifwelet a=1, then f(x)=a x becomes f(x)=1 x . Since 1 x =1 forallrealnumbers,
f(x)=1. This is the constant function.

that we have the properties of logarithms, we have additional methods we can use to solve logarithmic equations.
Ifourequationhastwologarithmswecanuseapropertythatsaysthatif logaM =logaN thenitistruethat M =N.
This is theOne-to-One Property of Logarithmic Equations.
One-to-One Property of Logarithmic Equations
For M >0, N >0, a>0, and a≠1 is any real number:
IflogaM =logaN, thenM =N.
To use this property, we must be certain that both sides of the equation are written with the same base.
Rememberthatlogarithmsaredefinedonlyforpositiverealnumbers.Checkyourresultsintheoriginalequation.You
may have obtained a result that gives a logarithm of zero or a negative number.

Solve Exponential Equations Using Logarithms
Inthesectiononexponentialfunctions,wesolvedsomeequationsbywritingbothsidesoftheequationwiththesame
base. Next we wrote a new equation by setting the exponents equal.
Itisnotalwayspossibleorconvenienttowritetheexpressionswiththesamebase.Inthatcaseweoftentakethecommon
logarithm or natural logarithm of both sides once the exponential is isolated.
EXAMPLE 10.41
Solve 5 x =11. Find the exact answer and then approximate it to three decimal places.
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col31234/1.3

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions 1083
Solution
x
5 = 11
Since the exponential is isolated, take the logarithm of both sides. log5 x = log11
Use the Power Property to get the x as a factor, not an exponent.
xlog5 = log11
Solve for x. Find the exact answer. x = log11
log5
Approximate the answer. x ≈ 1.490
Since 5 1 =5 and 5 2 =25, does it makes sense that 5 1.490 ≈11?
TRY IT : :10.81 Solve 7 x =43. Find the exact answer and then approximate it to three decimal places.
TRY IT : :10.82 Solve 8 x =98. Find the exact answer and then approximate it to three decimal places.
When we take the logarithm of both sides we will get the same result whether we use the common or the natural
logarithm(tryusingthenaturalloginthelastexample.Didyougetthesameresult?)Whentheexponentialhasbasee,
we use the natural logarithm.
EXAMPLE 10.42
Solve 3e x+2 =24. Find the exact answer and then approximate it to three decimal places.
Solution
x+2
3e = 24
Isolate the exponential by dividing both sides by 3. e x+2 = 8
Take the natural logarithm of both sides. lne x+2 = ln8
Use the Power Property to get the x as a factor, not an exponent. (x+2)lne = ln8
Use the property lne=1 to simplify. x+2 = ln8
Solve the equation. Find the exact answer. x = ln8−2
Approximate the answer. x ≈ 0.079

Use Exponential Models in Applications
Inprevioussectionswewereabletosolvesomeapplicationsthatweremodeledwithexponentialequations.Nowthatwe
have so many more options to solve these equations, we are able to solve more applications.
We will again use the Compound Interest Formulas and so we list them here for reference.

Let the lower left side of the bridge be the
origin of the coordinate grid at the point
(0, 0).
Since the base is 20 feet wide the point
(20, 0) represents the lower right side.
The bridge is 10 feet high at the highest
point. The highest point is the vertex of
the parabola so they-coordinate of the
vertex will be 10.
Since the bridge is symmetric, the vertex
must fall halfway between the left most
point, (0, 0), and the rightmost point
(20, 0). From this we know that the
x-coordinate of the vertex will also be 10.

distances from two fixed points is constant. Each of the given points is called afocusof the ellipse.

Determine if a Sequence is Arithmetic
The last section introduced sequences and now we will look at two specific types of sequences that each have special
properties. In this section we will look at arithmetic sequences and in the next section, geometric sequences.

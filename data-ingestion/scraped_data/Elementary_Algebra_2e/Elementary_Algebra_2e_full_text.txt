Use Place Value with Whole Numbers
Themostbasicnumbersusedinalgebraarethenumbersweusetocountobjectsinourworld:1,2,3,4,andsoon.These
are called the counting numbers. Counting numbers are also called natural numbers. If we add zero to the counting
numbers, we get the set ofwhole numbers.
Counting Numbers: 1, 2, 3, …
Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, …
The notation “…” is called ellipsis and means “and so on,” or that the pattern continues endlessly.
We can visualize counting numbers and whole numbers on anumber line(seeFigure 1.2).
Figure 1.2 The numbers on the number line get larger as they go from left to right, and smaller as
they go from right to left. While this number line shows only the whole numbers 0 through 6, the
numbers keep going without end.

HOW TO : :NAME A WHOLE NUMBER IN WORDS.
Step 1. Start at the left and name the number in each period, followed by the period name.
Step 2. Put commas in the number to separate the periods.
Step 3. Do not name the ones period.
EXAMPLE 1.2
Name the number 8,165,432,098,710 using words.
Solution
Name the number in each period, followed by the period name.

Put the commas in to separate the periods.
So, 8, 165, 432, 098, 710 is named as eight trillion, one hundred sixty-five billion, four hundred thirty-two million,
ninety-eight thousand, seven hundred ten.

HOW TO : :WRITE A WHOLE NUMBER USING DIGITS.
Step 1. Identify the words that indicate periods. (Remember, the ones period is never named.)
Step 2. Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period. Separate the
periods by commas.
Step 3. Name the number in each period and place the digits in the correct place value position.

Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the given place value.
Step 3. Is this digit greater than or equal to 5?
◦ Yes–add 1 to the digit in the given place value.
◦ No–donotchange the digit in the given place value.
Step 4. Replace all digits to the right of the given place value with zeros.

10 Chapter 1 Foundations
EXAMPLE 1.5
Round 103,978 to the nearest:
ⓐhundred ⓑthousand ⓒten thousand
Solution
ⓐ
Locate the hundreds place in 103,978.
Underline the digit to the right of the hundreds place.
Since 7 is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the 9. Replace all digits
to the right of the hundreds place with zeros.
So, 104,000 is 103,978 rounded to
the nearest hundred.
ⓑ
Locate the thousands place and underline the digit to the right of
the thousands place.
Since 9 is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to the 3. Replace all digits
to the right of the hundreds place with zeros.
So, 104,000 is 103,978 rounded to
the nearest thousand.
ⓒ
Locate the ten thousands place and underline the digit to the
right of the ten thousands place.
Since 3 is less than 5, we leave the 0 as is, and then replace
the digits to the right with zeros.
So, 100,000 is 103,978 rounded to the
nearest ten thousand.

Divisibility Tests
A number is divisible by:
• 2 if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
• 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
• 5 if the last digit is 5 or 0.
• 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
• 10 if it ends with 0.
EXAMPLE 1.6
Is 5,625 divisible by 2? By 3? By 5? By 6? By 10?
Solution
Is 5,625 divisible by 2?
No.
Does it end in 0,2,4,6, or 8?
5,625 is not divisible by 2.
Is 5,625 divisible by 3?
What is the sum of the digits? 5+6+2+5=18
Is the sum divisible by 3? Yes. 5,625 is divisble by 3.
Is 5,625 divisible by 5 or 10?
What is the last digit? It is 5. 5,625 is divisble by 5 but not by 10.
Is 5,625 divisible by 6?
Is it divisible by both 2 or 3? No, 5,625 is not divisible by 2, so 5,625 is not divisible by 6.

most often to find the least common multiple and we will look at both of them.
The first method is the Listing Multiples Method. To find the least common multiple of 12 and 18, we list the first few
multiples of 12 and 18:
Notice that some numbers appear in both lists. They are thecommon multiplesof 12 and 18.
We see that the first few common multiples of 12 and 18 are 36, 72, and 108. Since 36 is the smallest of the common
multiples, we call it theleast common multiple.We often use the abbreviation LCM.
Least Common Multiple
Theleast common multiple(LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
The procedure box lists the steps to take to find the LCM using the prime factors method we used above for 12 and 18.
HOW TO : :FIND THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE BY LISTING MULTIPLES.
Step 1. List several multiples of each number.
Step 2. Look for the smallest number that appears on both lists.
Step 3. This number is the LCM.
EXAMPLE 1.9

Solution
Make lists of the first few multiples of 15 and of 20,
and use them to find the least common multiple.

Multiplication a·b, ab, (a)(b), atimesb the product ofaandb
(a)b, a(b)
Division a÷b, a/b, a , ba adivided the quotient ofaandb,ais called the dividend, and
b byb bis called the divisor
We perform these operations on two numbers. When translating from symbolic form to English, or from English to
symbolic form, pay attention to the words “of” and “and.”
• Thedifferenceof9and2meanssubtract9and2,inotherwords,9minus2,whichwewritesymbolicallyas 9−2.

When two quantities have the same value, we say they are equal and connect them with anequal sign.

Identify and Combine Like Terms
Algebraicexpressionsaremadeupofterms.Atermisaconstant,ortheproductofaconstantandoneormorevariables.
Term
Atermis a constant, or the product of a constant and one or more variables.
Examples of terms are 7, y, 5x 2 , 9a, andb 5 .
The constant that multiplies the variable is called thecoefficient.
Coefficient
Thecoefficientof a term is the constant that multiplies the variable in a term.

The 7 and the 4 are both constant terms.
The5xand the 3xare both terms withx.
The n 2 and the 9n 2 are both terms with n 2 .
When two terms are constants or have the same variable and exponent, we say they arelike terms.
• 7 and 4 are like terms.
• 5xand 3xare like terms.
• x 2 and 9x 2 are like terms.
Like Terms
Terms that are either constants or have the same variables raised to the same powers are calledlike terms.
EXAMPLE 1.22
Identify the like terms: y 3 , 7x 2 , 14, 23, 4y 3 , 9x, 5x 2 .
Solution
y 3 and 4y 3 are like terms because both have y 3 ; the variable and the exponent match.
7x 2 and 5x 2 are like terms because both have x 2 ; the variable and the exponent match.
14 and 23 are like terms because both are constants.

A more thorough introduction to the topics covered in this section can be found in the Prealgebra chapter,
Integers.
Use Negatives and Opposites
Our work so far has only included the counting numbers and the whole numbers. But if you have ever experienced
a temperature below zero or accidentally overdrawn your checking account, you are already familiar with negative
numbers.Negativenumbersarenumberslessthan 0. Thenegativenumbersaretotheleftofzeroonthenumberline.
SeeFigure 1.6.

positive and negative numbers.
Thearrowsontheendsofthenumberlineindicatethatthenumberskeepgoingforever.Thereisnobiggestpositive
number, and there is no smallest negative number.
Is zero a positive or a negative number? Numbers larger than zero are positive, and numbers smaller than zero are
negative. Zero is neither positive nor negative.
Considerhownumbersareorderedonthenumberline.Goingfromlefttoright,thenumbersincreaseinvalue.Going
from right to left, the numbers decrease in value. SeeFigure 1.7.

Remember that we use the notation:
a<b(read “a is less than b”) when a is to the left of b on the number line.
a>b(read “ais greater thanb”) whenais to the right ofbon the number line.
Now we need to extend the number line which showed the whole numbers to include negative numbers, too. The

Sometimes in algebra the same symbol has different meanings. Just like some words in English, the specific meaning
becomes clear by looking at how it is used. You have seen the symbol “−” used in three different ways.
10−4 Between two numbers, it indicates the operation ofsubtraction.
We read10−4as“10minus4.”
−8 In front of a number, it indicates anegativenumber.
We read−8as “negative eight.”
−x In front of a variable, it indicates theopposite.We read−xas “the opposite ofx.”
−(−2) Here there are two“−”signs. The one in the parentheses tells us the number is
negative2.The one outside the parentheses tells us to take theoppositeof−2.
We read−(−2)as “the opposite of negative two.”
Between two numbers, it indicates the operation ofsubtraction.
10−4
We read 10−4 as "10 minus 4."

Absolute Value
Theabsolute valueof a number is its distance from 0 on the number line.
The absolute value of a numbernis written as |n|.
For example,
• −5is5 units away from 0, so |−5|=5.
• 5is5 units away from 0, so |5|=5.
Figure 1.10illustrates this idea.
Figure 1.10 The integers 5and are5 units away

Theabsolutevalueofanumberisnevernegative(becausedistancecannotbenegative).Theonlynumberwithabsolute
value equal to zero is the number zero itself, because the distance from 0to0 on the number line is zero units.
Property of Absolute Value

We let one color (blue) represent positive. The other color (red) will represent the negatives. If we have one positive

zero.
We will use the counters to show how to add the four addition facts using the numbers 5, −5 and 3, −3.
5+3 −5+(−3) −5+3 5+(−3)
To add 5+3, we realize that 5+3 means the sum of 5 and 3.
We start with 5 positives.
And then we add 3 positives.
We now have 8 positives. The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.
Now we will add −5+(−3). Watch for similarities to the last example 5+3=8.
To add −5+(−3), we realize this means the sum of −5and −3.
We start with 5 negatives.
And then we add 3 negatives.
We now have 8 negatives. The sum of −5 and −3 is −8.
In what ways were these first two examples similar?
• The first example adds 5 positives and 3 positives—both positives.
• The second example adds 5 negatives and 3 negatives—both negatives.
In each case we got 8—either 8 positives or 8 negatives.
When the signs were the same, the counters were all the same color, and so we added them.

−5 + 3 means the sum of −5 and 3.
We start with 5 negatives.
And then we add 3 positives.
We remove any neutral pairs.
We have 2 negatives left.
The sum of −5 and 3 is −2. −5 + 3 = −2
Notice that there were more negatives than positives, so the result was negative.
Let’s now add the last combination, 5+(−3).
5 + (−3) means the sum of 5 and −3.
We start with 5 positives.
And then we add 3 negatives.
We remove any neutral pairs.
We have 2 positives left.
The sum of 5 and −3 is 2. 5 + (−3) = 2
When we use counters to model addition of positive and negative integers, it is easy to see whether there are more
positive or more negative counters. So we know whether the sum will be positive or negative.

Add:ⓐ −1+5 ⓑ 1+(−5).

Wewillcontinuetousecounterstomodelthesubtraction.Remember,thebluecountersrepresentpositivenumbersand
the red counters represent negative numbers.
Perhaps when you were younger, you read “5−3” as “5 take away 3.” When you use counters, you can think of
subtraction the same way!
We will model the four subtraction facts using the numbers 5 and 3.
5−3 −5−(−3) −5−3 5−(−3)
To subtract 5−3, we restate the problem as “5 take away 3.”
We start with 5 positives.
We ‘take away’ 3 positives.
We have 2 positives left.
The difference of 5 and 3 is 2. 2
Now we will subtract −5−(−3). Watch for similarities to the last example 5−3=2.
To subtract −5−(−3), we restate this as “–5 take away –3”
We start with 5 negatives.
We ‘take away’ 3 negatives.
We have 2 negatives left.
The difference of −5 and −3 is −2. −2
Noticethatthesetwoexamplesaremuchalike:Thefirstexample,wesubtract3positivesfrom5positivesandendup

In the second example, we subtract 3 negatives from 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives.
Each example used counters of only one color, and the “take away” model of subtraction was easy to apply.

−5 − 3 means −5 take away 3.
We start with 5 negatives.
We now add the neutrals needed to get 3 positives.
We remove the 3 positives.
We are left with 8 negatives.
The difference of −5 and 3 is −8. −5 − 3 = −8
And now, the fourth case, 5−(−3). We start with 5 positives. We need to take away 3 negatives, but there are no
negatives to take away. So we add neutral pairs until we have 3 negatives to take away.

5 − (−3) means 5 take away −3.
We start with 5 positives.
We now add the needed neutrals pairs.
We remove the 3 negatives.

In summary:
5·3 = 15 −5(3) = −15
5(−3) = −15 (−5)(−3) = 15
Notice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the:
• signs are thesame, the product ispositive.
• signs aredifferent, the product isnegative.
We’ll put this all together in the chart below.
Multiplication of Signed Numbers
For multiplication of two signed numbers:
Same signs Product Example
Two positives Positive 7·4 = 28
Two negatives Positive −8(−6) = 48
Different signs Product Example
Positive · negative Negative 7(−9) = −63
Negative · positive Negative −5·10 = −50

−4is the opposite of4. 3is the opposite of−3.
Each time we multiply a number by −1, we get its opposite!

Multiplying a number by −1 gives its opposite.

Divide Integers
Whataboutdivision?Divisionistheinverseoperationofmultiplication.So, 15÷3=5 because 5·3=15. Inwords,
thisexpressionsaysthat15canbedividedintothreegroupsoffiveeachbecauseaddingfivethreetimesgives15.Look
at some examples of multiplying integers, to figure out the rules for dividing integers.
5·3 = 15so15÷3 = 5 −5(3) = −15so−15÷3 = −5
(−5)(−3) = 15so15÷(−3) = −5 5(−3) = −15so−15÷(−3) = 5
Division follows the same rules as multiplication!
For division of two signed numbers, when the:
• signs are thesame, the quotient ispositive.
• signs aredifferent, the quotient isnegative.
And remember that we can always check the answer of a division problem by multiplying.
Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers
For multiplication and division of two signed numbers:
• If the signs are the same, the result is positive.
• If the signs are different, the result is negative.
Same signs Result
Two positives Positive
Two negatives Positive
If the signs are the same, the result is positive.
Different signs Result
Positive and negative Negative
Negative and positive Negative
If the signs are different, the result is negative.
EXAMPLE 1.48

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
When multiplying fractions, the properties of positive and negative numbers still apply, of course. It is a good idea to
determine the sign of the product as the first step. In Example 1.68, we will multiply negative and a positive, so the
product will be negative.
EXAMPLE 1.68

HOW TO : :ADD OR SUBTRACT FRACTIONS.
Step 1. Do they have a common denominator?
◦ Yes—go to step 2.
◦ No—rewrite each fraction with the LCD (least common denominator). Find the LCD.
Change each fraction into an equivalent fraction with the LCD as its denominator.
Step 2. Add or subtract the fractions.
Step 3. Simplify, if possible.
When finding the equivalent fractions needed to create the common denominators, there is a quick way to find the
numberweneedtomultiplyboththenumeratoranddenominator.ThismethodworksifwefoundtheLCDbyfactoring
into primes.
LookatthefactorsoftheLCDandthenateachcolumnabovethosefactors.The“missing”factorsofeachdenominator
are the numbers we need.
InExample 1.81, the LCD, 36, has two factors of 2 and two factors of 3.
The numerator 12 has two factors of 2 but only one of 3—so it is “missing” one 3—we multiply the numerator and
denominator by 3.
The numerator 18 is missing one factor of 2—so we multiply the numerator and denominator by 2.

We will apply this method as we subtract the fractions inExample 1.82.
EXAMPLE 1.82
7 19
Subtract: − .
15 24
Solution
Do the fractions have a common denominator? No, so we need to find the LCD.
Find the LCD.
Notice, 15 is “missing” three factors of 2 and 24 is “missing” the 5 from the factors
of the LCD. So we multiply 8 in the first fraction and 5 in the second fraction to get
the LCD.
Rewrite as equivalent fractions with the LCD.

We multiply the numbers just as we do whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal point. We then count the
number of decimal points in the factors and that sum tells us the number of decimal places in the product.
The rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers apply to decimals, too, of course!
Whenmultiplyingtwo numbers,
• if their signs are thesamethe product ispositive.
• if their signs aredifferentthe product isnegative.

HOW TO : :DIVIDE DECIMALS.
Step 1. Determine the sign of the quotient.
Step 2. Make the divisor a whole number by “moving” the decimal point all the way to the right.
“Move” the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places—adding zeros as
needed.
Step 3. Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.
Step 4. Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.
EXAMPLE 1.100
Divide: −25.65÷(−0.06).
Solution
Remember, you can “move” the decimals in the divisor and dividend because of the Equivalent Fractions Property.
−25.65÷(−0.06)
The signs are the same. The quotient is positive.
Make the divisor a whole number by “moving” the decimal point all the way
to the right.
“Move” the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places.

Irrational Number
Anirrational numberis a number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers.
Its decimal form does not stop and does not repeat.
Let’s summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is rational or irrational.
Rational or Irrational?
If the decimal form of a number
• repeats or stops, the number isrational.
• does not repeat and does not stop, the number isirrational.

Given the numbers 0.583, 0.47, 3.605551275... list theⓐrational numbersⓑirrational numbers.
Solution
–
The 3 repeats in 0.583.
ⓐ
The decimal 0.47 stops after the 7.
Look for decimals that repeat or stop. –
So 0.583 and 0.47 are rational.

For each number given, identify whether it is rational or irrational:ⓐ 36 ⓑ 44.
Solution
ⓐRecognize that 36 is a perfect square, since 6 2 =36. So 36=6, therefore 36 is rational.
ⓑRememberthat 6 2 =36 and 7 2 =49, so44isnotaperfectsquare.Therefore,thedecimalformof 44

numbers. The irrational numbers are numbers whose decimal form does not stop and does not repeat. When we put
together the rational numbers and the irrational numbers, we get the set ofreal numbers.
Real Number
Areal numberis a number that is either rational or irrational.
All the numbers we use in elementary algebra are real numbers. Figure 1.15 illustrates how the number sets we’ve
discussed in this section fit together.
Figure 1.15 This chart shows the number sets that make up the set of real numbers.
Does the term “real numbers” seem strange to you? Are there any numbers that are not
“real,” and, if so, what could they be?
Can we simplify −25? Is there a number whose square is −25?
( )2 =−25?

136 Chapter 1 Foundations
Noneofthenumbersthatwehavedealtwithsofarhasasquarethatis −25. Why?Anypositive numbersquaredis
positive. Any negative number squared is positive. So we say there is no real number equal to −25.
The square root of a negative number is not a real number.
EXAMPLE 1.113
For each number given, identify whether it is a real number or not a real number:ⓐ −169 ⓑ − 64.
Solution
ⓐThere is no real number whose square is −169. Therefore, −169 is not a real number.
ⓑ Since the negative is in front of the radical, − 64 is −8, Since −8 is a real number, − 64 is a real
number.

Use the Commutative and Associative Properties
Think about adding two numbers, say 5 and 3. The order we add them doesn’t affect the result, does it?
5+3 3+5
8 8
5+3=3+5
The results are the same.
As we can see, the order in which we add does not matter!
What about multiplying 5and3?
5·3 3·5
15 15
5·3=3·5
Again, the results are the same!
The order in which we multiply does not matter!

Commutative Property
of Addition Ifa, bare real numbers, then a+b = b+a
of Multiplication Ifa, bare real numbers, then a·b = b·a
When adding or multiplying, changing theordergives the same result.
Thecommutativepropertyhastodowithorder.Ifyouchangetheorderofthenumberswhenaddingormultiplying,the
result is the same.
What about subtraction? Does order matter when we subtract numbers? Does 7−3 give the same result as 3−7?
7−3 3−7
4 −4
4≠−4
7−3≠3−7
The results are not the same.
Since changing the order of the subtraction did not give the same result, we know thatsubtraction is not commutative.
Let’s see what happens when we divide two numbers. Isdivisioncommutative?

The results are not the same.
Since changing the order of the division did not give the same result, division is not commutative. The commutative
properties only apply to addition and multiplication!
• Addition and multiplicationarecommutative.
• Subtraction and Divisionare notcommutative.
If you were asked to simplify this expression, how would you do it and what would your answer be?
7+8+2
Some people would think 7+8is15 and then 15+2is17. Others might start with 8+2makes10 and then
7+10makes17.

When adding three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result.
This is true for multiplication, too.

Notice it is the same three numbers in the same order—the only difference is the grouping.

the next example, we will use the commutative property of addition to write the like terms together.

When we have to simplify algebraic expressions, we can often make the work easier by applying the commutative
or associative property first, instead of automatically following the order of operations. When adding or subtracting
fractions, combine those with a common denominator first.

We call −a. the additive inverse of a. The opposite of a number is its additive inverse. A number and its opposite add
to zero, which is the additive identity. This leads to the Inverse Property of Addition that states for any real number
a, a+(−a)=0. Remember, a number and its opposite add to zero.

Use the Properties of Zero
Theidentitypropertyofadditionsaysthatwhenweadd0toanynumber,theresultisthatsamenumber.Whathappens
when we multiply a number by 0? Multiplying by 0 makes theproductequal zero.
Multiplication by Zero
For any real numbera.
a·0=0 0·a=0
The product of any real number and 0 is 0.
Whataboutdivisioninvolvingzero?Whatis 0÷3? Thinkaboutarealexample:Iftherearenocookiesinthecookiejar
and3peoplearetosharethem,howmanycookiesdoeseachpersonget?Therearenocookiestoshare,soeachperson
gets 0 cookies. So,
0÷3=0
We can check division with the related multiplication fact.
12÷6=2because2·6=12.
So we know 0÷3=0 because 0·3=0.
Division of Zero
0
For any real numbera, except 0, =0 and 0÷a=0.
a
Zero divided by any real number except zero is zero.
Now think about dividing by zero. What is the result of dividing 4 by 0? Think about the related multiplication fact:
4÷0= ? means ?·0=4. Isthereanumberthatmultipliedby0gives4?Sinceanyrealnumbermultipliedby0gives
0, there is no real number that can be multiplied by 0 to obtain 4.
We conclude that there is no answer to 4÷0 and so we say that division by 0 is undefined.
Division by Zero

For any real numbera, except 0, and a÷0 are undefined.

Division by zero is undefined.

Simplify Expressions Using the Distributive Property
Supposethatthreefriendsaregoingtothemovies.Theyeachneed$9.25—that’s9dollarsand1quarter—topayfortheir
tickets. How much money do they need all together?
Youcanthinkaboutthedollarsseparatelyfromthequarters.Theyneed3times$9so$27,and3times1quarter,so75
cents. In total, they need $27.75. If you think about doing the math in this way, you are using thedistributive property.
Distributive Property
Ifa, b, care real numbers, then a(b+c)=ab+ac
Also, (b+c)a=ba+ca
a(b−c)=ab−ac
(b−c)a=ba−ca
Back to our friends at the movies, we could find the total amount of money they need like this:
3(9.25)
3(9 + 0.25)
3(9) + 3(0.25)
27 + 0.75
27.75
In algebra, we use thedistributive propertyto remove parentheses as we simplify expressions.

• Place Valueas inFigure 1.3.
• Name a Whole Number in Words
Step 1. Start at the left and name the number in each period, followed by the period name.
Step 2. Put commas in the number to separate the periods.
Step 3. Do not name the ones period.
• Write a Whole Number Using Digits
Step 1. Identify the words that indicate periods. (Remember the ones period is never named.)
Step 2. Draw 3 blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas.
Step 3. Name the number in each period and place the digits in the correct place value position.
• Round Whole Numbers
Step 1. Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow. All digits to the left of the arrow do not change.
Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the given place value.
Step 3. Is this digit greater than or equal to 5?
▪ Yes—add 1 to the digit in the given place value.
▪ No—donotchange the digit in the given place value.
Step 4. Replace all digits to the right of the given place value with zeros.
• Divisibility Tests:A number is divisible by:
◦ 2 if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
◦ 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
◦ 5 if the last digit is 5 or 0.
◦ 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

of the variable that makes the equation true is called a solution to the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle!
Solution of an equation
Asolution of an equationis a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.
HOW TO : :TO DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.
Step 1. Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation.
Step 2. Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.
Step 3. Determine whether the resulting equation is true (the left side is equal to the right side)
◦ If it is true, the number is a solution.
◦ If it is not true, the number is not a solution.

are “hidden” in the envelope. Can you tell how many counters are in the envelope?
Figure 2.2 The illustration shows a model
of an equation with one variable. On the left
side of the workspace is an unknown
(envelope) and three counters, while on the
right side of the workspace are eight
counters.
What are you thinking? What steps are you taking in your mind to figure out how many counters are in the envelope?
Perhapsyouarethinking:“Ineedtoremovethe3countersatthebottomlefttogettheenvelopebyitself.The3counters
on the left can be matched with 3 on the right and so I can take them away from both sides. That leaves five on the
right—so there must be 5 counters in the envelope.” SeeFigure 2.3for an illustration of this process.
Figure 2.3 The illustration shows a model for solving an equation with
one variable. On both sides of the workspace remove three counters,
leaving only the unknown (envelope) and five counters on the right
side. The unknown is equal to five counters.

and the center line takes the place of the equal sign. We will call the contents of the envelope x.
Figure 2.4 The illustration shows a model
for the equation x+3=8.
Let’s write algebraically the steps we took to discover how many counters were in the envelope:
First, we took away three from each side.
Then we were left with five.
Check:
Five in the envelope plus three more does equal eight!

Subtraction Property of Equality
For any numbersa,b, andc,
If a = b,
then a−c = b−c
When you subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.
MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

You should always simplify as much as possible before you try to isolate the variable. Remember that to simplify an
expression means to do all the operations in the expression. Simplify one side of the equation at a time. Note that
simplificationis different from the process used to solve an equation in which we apply an operation to both sides.

Most of the time a question that requires an algebraic solution comes out of a real life question. To begin with that
question is asked in English (or the language of the person asking) and not in math symbols. Because of this, it is an
important skill to be able to translate an everyday situation into algebraic language.
We will start by restating the problem in just one sentence, assign avariable, and then translate the sentence into an

unknown (envelope), while on the right side
of the workspace are six counters.

This example leads to theDivision Property of Equality.
The Division Property of Equality
For any numbersa,b, andc, and c≠0,
If a = b,
a b
then =
c c
When you divide both sides of an equation by any non-zero number, you still have equality.

Solve Equations with Variables on Both Sides
What if there are variables on both sides of the equation? For equations like this, begin as we did above—choose a
“variable” side and a “constant” side, and then use the subtraction and addition properties of equality to collect all
variables on one side and all constants on the other side.
EXAMPLE 2.29
Solve: 9x=8x−6.
Solution
Here the variable is on both sides, but the constants only appear on the right side, so let’s make the right side the

Step 1. Choose which side will be the “variable” side—the other side will be the “constant” side.
Step 2. Collect the variable terms to the “variable” side of the equation, using the Addition or
Subtraction Property of Equality.
Step 3. Collectalltheconstantstotheothersideoftheequation,usingtheAdditionorSubtraction

usually makes the arithmetic easier.
EXAMPLE 2.33
Solve: 8n−4=−2n+6.
Solution
In the first step, choose the variable side by comparing the coefficients of the variables on each side.
Since 8>−2, make the left side the “variable” side.
We don’t want variable terms on the right side—add 2n to both sides to leave
only constants on the right.
Combine like terms.
We don’t want any constants on the left side, so add 4 to both sides.
Simplify.
The variable term is on the left and the constant term is on the right. To get the
coefficient of n to be one, divide both sides by 10.

Properties of Equality
Subtraction Property of Equality Addition Property of Equality
For any numbersa, b, andc, For any numbersa, b, andc,
if a = b, if a = b,
then a−c = b−c. then a+c = b+c.
Similar properties hold true for inequalities.
For example, we know that −4 is less than 2.
If we subtract 5 from both quantities, is the
left side still less than the right side?
We get −9 on the left and −3 on the right.
And we know −9 is less than −3.
The inequality sign stayed the same.
Similarly we could show that the inequality also stays the same for addition.
This leads us to the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Inequality.
Properties of Inequality
Subtraction Property of Inequality Addition Property of Inequality
For any numbersa, b, andc, For any numbersa, b, andc,
if a < b if a < b
then a−c < b−c. then a+c < b+c.
if a > b if a > b
then a−c > b−c. then a+c > b+c.

then we’ll use it to solve some problems. We summarize below an effective strategy for problem solving.
HOW TO : :USE A PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY TO SOLVE WORD PROBLEMS.
Step 1. Readthe problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for.
Step 3. Namewhat we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
Step 4. Translateintoanequation.Itmaybehelpfultorestatetheprobleminonesentencewithall
the important information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation.
Step 5. Solvethe equation using good algebra techniques.
Step 6. Checkthe answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Step 7. Answerthe question with a complete sentence.
EXAMPLE 3.1
Pilar bought a purse on sale for $18, which is one-half of the original price. What was the original price of the purse?
Solution
Step1.Readtheproblem.Readtheproblemtwoormoretimesifnecessary.Lookupanyunfamiliarwordsinadictionary
or on the internet.
• In this problem, is it clear what is being discussed? Is every word familiar?
Step2.Identifywhatyouarelookingfor.Didyouevergointoyourbedroomtogetsomethingandthenforgetwhatyou
werelookingfor?It’shardtofindsomethingifyouarenotsurewhatitis!Readtheproblemagainandlookforwords
that tell you what you are looking for!
• In this problem, the words “what was the original price of the purse” tell us what we need to find.
Step3.Namewhatwearelookingfor.Chooseavariabletorepresentthatquantity.Wecanuseanyletterforthevariable,
but choose one that makes it easy to remember what it represents.
• Let p= the original price of the purse.
Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important
information. Translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation.
Reread the problem carefully to see how the given information is related. Often, there is one sentence that gives this
information,oritmayhelptowriteonesentencewithalltheimportantinformation.Lookforcluewordstohelptranslate
the sentence into algebra. Translate the sentence into an equation.
Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important
information.
Translate into an equation.
Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebraic techniques. Even if you know the solution right away, using good
algebraic techniques here will better prepare you to solve problems that do not have obvious answers.
Solve the equation.
Multiply both sides by 2.
Simplify.
Step6.Checktheanswerintheproblemtomakesureitmakessense.Wesolvedtheequationandfoundthat p=36,
which means “the original price” was $36.

304 Chapter 3 Math Models
• Does$36makesenseintheproblem?Yes,because18isone-halfof36,andthepursewasonsaleathalftheoriginal
price.
Step 7. Answerthe question with a complete sentence. The problem asked “What was the original price of the purse?”
• The answer to the question is: “The original price of the purse was $36.”
If this were a homework exercise, our work might look like this:
Pilar bought a purse on sale for $18, which is one-half the original price. What was the original price of the purse?
Let p= the original price.
18 is one-half the original price.
Multiply both sides by 2.
Simplify.
Check. Is $36 a reasonable price for a purse?
Yes.
Is 18 one half of 36?
? 1
18= ⋅36
2
18=18✓
The original price of the purse was $36.

Step 6. Check.First, is our answer reasonable? Yes, having 4
boys in a study group seems OK. The problem says the
number of girls was 3 more than twice the number of boys.
If there are four boys, does that make eleven girls? Twice 4
boys is 8. Three more than 8 is 11.

338 Chapter 3 Math Models
Total Value of Coins
For the same type of coin, the total value of a number of coins is found by using the model
number·value=totalvalue
where
numberis the number of coins
valueis the value of each coin
total valueis the total value of all the coins
The number of dimes times the value of each dime equals the total value of the dimes.
number·value = totalvalue
17·$0.10 = $1.70
Wecouldcontinuethisprocessforeachtypeofcoin,andthenwewouldknowthetotalvalueofeachtypeofcoin.Toget
the total value ofallthe coins, add the total value of each type of coin.
Let’s look at a specific case. Suppose there are 14 quarters, 17 dimes, 21 nickels, and 39 pennies.
The total value of all the coins is $6.64.
Notice how the chart helps organize all the information! Let’s see how we use this method to solve a coin word problem.

• Determine the types of coins involved.
Thinkaboutthestrategyweusedtofindthevalueofthehandfulofcoins.Thefirstthingweneedistonoticewhat
types of coins are involved. Adalberto has dimes and nickels.
• Create a tableto organize the information. See chart below.
◦ Label the columns “type,” “number,” “value,” “total value.”
◦ List the types of coins.
◦ Write in the value of each type of coin.
◦ Write in the total value of all the coins.

Thevalueofadimeis$0.10andthevalueofanickelis$0.05.Thetotalvalueofallthecoinsis$2.25.Thetable
below shows this information.
Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for.
• We are asked to find the number of dimes and nickels Adalberto has.
Step 3. Namewhat we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
• Use variable expressions to represent the number of each type of coin and write them in the table.
• Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of coin.

number of dimes.
Letd = number of dimes.
d+9 = number of nickels
Fill in the “number” column in the table to help get everything organized.
Now we have all the information we need from the problem!
We multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of coin. While we do not know the actual
number, we do have an expression to represent it.
And so now multiply number·value=totalvalue. See how this is done in the table below.
Notice that we made the heading of the table show the model.
Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence. Translate the English
sentence into an algebraic equation.
Write the equation by adding the total values of all the types of coins.
Step 5. Solvethe equation using good algebra techniques.
Now solve this equation.
Distribute.
Combine like terms.
Subtract 0.45 from each side.
Divide.
So there are 12 dimes.
The number of nickels is d+9.

Step 1. Readthe problem.
Determine the types of coins involved.
We know that Maria has quarters and pennies.
Create a table to organize the information.
• Label the columns “type,” “number,” “value,” “total value.”
• List the types of coins.
• Write in the value of each type of coin.
• Write in the total value of all the coins.
Step 2. Identifywhat you are looking for.
• We are looking for the number of quarters and pennies.
Step 3. Name.Represent the number of quarters and pennies using variables.

342 Chapter 3 Math Models
• We know Maria has twice as many pennies as quarters. The number of pennies is defined in terms of quarters.
• Letqrepresent the number of quarters.
• Then the number of pennies is 2q.
Multiply the ‘number’ and the ‘value’ to get the ‘total value’ of each type of coin.
Step 4. Translate.Write the equation by adding the ‘total value’ of all the types of coins.
Step 5. Solvethe equation. 0.25q+0.01(2q) = 2.43
Multiply. 0.25q+0.02q = 2.43
Combine like terms. 0.27q = 2.43
Divide by 0.27. q = 9quarters

The number of pennies is 2q. 2·9
18 pennies
Step 6. Checkthe answer in the problem.
Maria has 9 quarters and 18 pennies. Does this make

Solution
Step 1. Readthe problem.
• Determine the types of tickets involved. There are student tickets and adult tickets.
• Create a table to organize the information.
Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for.
• We are looking for the number of student and adult tickets.
Step 3. Name.Represent the number of each type of ticket using variables.
We know the number of adult tickets sold was five less than three times the number of student tickets sold.
• Letsbe the number of student tickets.
• Then 3s−5 is the number of adult tickets
Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of ticket.
Step 4. Translate.Write the equation by adding the total values of each type of ticket.
6s+9(3s−5)=1506
Step 5. Solvethe equation.
6s+27s−45 = 1506

The 10 pounds of trail mix will come from mixing raisins and nuts.
Letx=number of pounds of raisins.
10−x=number of pounds of nuts
We enter the price per pound for each item.
We multiply the number times the value to get the total value.
Notice that the last line in the table gives the information for the total amount of the mixture.
We know the value of the raisins plus the value of the nuts will be the value of the trail mix.

Letx = amount invested at 3%.
20,000−x = amount invested at 5%
The amount invested is theprincipalfor each account.
We enter the interest rate for each account.
We multiply the amount invested times the rate to get the interest.

speed of the local train. Find the speed of both trains.
Solution
Step 1. Readthe problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
• Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening. Shown below is a sketch of what is happening in the example.
• Create a table to organize the information.
• Label the columns “Rate,” “Time,” and “Distance.”

380 Chapter 3 Math Models
• List the two scenarios.
• Write in the information you know.
Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for.
• We are asked to find the speed of both trains.
• Noticethatthedistanceformulausestheword“rate,”butitismorecommontouse“speed”whenwetalkabout
vehicles in everyday English.
Step 3. Namewhat we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
• Complete the chart
• Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.
• Wearelookingforthespeedofthetrains.Let’sletrrepresentthespeedofthelocaltrain.Sincethespeedofthe
express train is 12 mph faster, we represent that as r+12.
r = speed of the local train
r+12 = speed of the express train
Fill in the speeds into the chart.
Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.
Step 4. Translateinto an equation.
• Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
• Then, translate the sentence into an equation.
• Theequationtomodelthissituationwillcomefromtherelationbetweenthedistances.Lookatthediagramwe
drew above. How is the distance travelled by the express train related to the distance travelled by the local train?
• Since both trains leave from Pittsburgh and travel to Washington, D.C. they travel the same distance. So we write:
Step 5. Solvethe equation using good algebra techniques.
Now solve this equation.
So the speed of the local train is 48 mph.
Find the speed of the express train.
The speed of the express train is 60 mph.

Solution
Step 1. Readthe problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
• Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening. Below shows a sketch of what is happening in the example.
• Create a table to organize the information.
• Label the columns rate, time, distance.
• List the two scenarios.
• Write in the information you know.
Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for.
• We are asked to find the average speeds of Christopher and his parents.
Step 3. Namewhat we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
• Complete the chart.

382 Chapter 3 Math Models
• Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.
• We are looking for their average speeds. Let’s let r represent the average speed of the parents. Since the
Christopher’s speed is 10 mph faster, we represent that as r+10.
Fill in the speeds into the chart.
Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.
Step 4. Translateinto an equation.
• Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
• Then, translate the sentence into an equation.
• Again,weneedtoidentifyarelationshipbetweenthedistancesinordertowriteanequation.Lookatthediagram
we created above and notice the relationship between the distance Christopher traveled and the distance his
parents traveled.
The distance Christopher travelled plus the distance his parents travel must add up to 115 miles. So we write:
Step 5. Solvethe equation using good algebra techniques.
1.5(r+10)+r = 115
1.5r+15+r = 115
Now solve this equation. 2.5r+15 = 115
2.5r = 100
r = 40
So the parents' speed was 40 mph.
r+10
Christopher's speed is r+10. 40+10
50
Christopher's speed was 50 mph.
Table 3.12
Step 6. Checkthe answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Christopher drove 50 mph (1.5 hours) = 75 miles
40 mph (1 hours) = _4_0_ m__il_e_s
His parents drove

Solution
Step 1. Readthe problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
• Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening.
• Create a table to organize the information.
Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for.
• We are asked to find the amount of time the trucks will travel until they are 325 miles apart.

miles per hour faster, we will call that speed r+3. We write the speeds in the chart.
The speed is in miles per hour, so we need to express the times in hours, too, in order for the units to be the same.
Remember, one hour is 60 minutes. So:
30 1
30 minutes is or hour
60 2
15 1
15 minutes is or hour
60 4
Next, we multiply rate times time to fill in the distance column.

‘coordinate plane’.
The horizontal number line is called the x-axis. The vertical number line is called the y-axis. The x-axis and the y-axis
together form the rectangular coordinate system. These axes divide a plane into four regions, called quadrants. The
quadrantsareidentifiedbyRomannumerals,beginningontheupperrightandproceedingcounterclockwise.SeeFigure

Figure 4.2 ‘Quadrant’ has the root ‘quad,’
which means ‘four.’
Intherectangularcoordinatesystem,everypointisrepresentedbyanorderedpair.Thefirstnumberintheorderedpair
is thex-coordinateof the point, and the second number is they-coordinateof the point.
Ordered Pair
Anordered pair, (x, y), gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system.
The first number is thex-coordinate.
The second number is they-coordinate.

theequationyougotexactlyonesolution.Theprocessofsolvinganequationendedwithastatementlike x=4.(Then,
you checked the solution by substituting back into the equation.)
Here’s an example of an equation in one variable, and its one solution.
3x+5 = 17
3x = 12
x = 4
But equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two variables may be of the form Ax+By=C.
Equations of this form are calledlinear equations in two variables.
Linear Equation
An equation of the form Ax+By=C, where A and B are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two
variables.
Notice the wordlineinlinear. Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables, x and y.
Theequation y=−3x+5 isalsoalinearequation.Butitdoesnotappeartobeintheform Ax+By=C.Wecanuse
the Addition Property of Equality and rewrite it in Ax+By=C form.

420 Chapter 4 Graphs
y = −3x+5
Add to both sides. y+3x = −3x+5+3x
Simplify. y+3x = 5
Use the Commutative Property to put it in Ax+By=C form. 3x+y = 5
Table 4.1
Byrewriting y=−3x+5 as 3x+y=5,wecaneasilyseethatitisalinearequationintwovariablesbecauseitisofthe
form Ax+By=C. When an equation is in the form Ax+By=C, we say it is instandard form.
Standard Form of Linear Equation
A linear equation is in standard form when it is written Ax+By=C.
Most people prefer to have A, B, and C be integers and A≥0 when writing a linear equation in standard form,
although it is not strictly necessary.
Linearequationshaveinfinitelymanysolutions.Foreverynumberthatissubstitutedfor x thereisacorresponding y
value. This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair (x, y). When we

What is the run?
The rubber band goes across 3 units. The run is 3 (seeFigure 4.22).
The slope of a line is the ratio of the rise to the run. In mathematics, it is always referred to with the letter m.

Slope-Intercept Form of an Equation of a Line
Theslope–intercept formof an equation of a line with slope m andy-intercept, (0, b) is,
y=mx+b
Sometimes the slope–intercept form is called the “y-form.”
EXAMPLE 4.40
Use the graph to find the slope andy-intercept of the line, y=2x+1.
Compare these values to the equationy=mx+b.
Solution
To find the slope of the line, we need to choose two points on the line. We’ll use the points (0, 1) and (1, 3).
Find the rise and run.
Find they-intercept of the line. They-intercept is the point (0, 1).
The slope is the same as the coefficient of x and they-coordinate of they-intercept is the same as the constant term.

You are at an exciting point in your mathematical journey as the mathematics you are studying has interesting
applications in the real world.
The physical sciences, social sciences, and the business world are full of situations that can be modeled with linear
equations relating two variables. Data is collected and graphed. If the data points appear to form a straight line, an
equation of that line can be used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other variable.
To create a mathematical model of a linear relation between two variables, we must be able to find the equation of
theline.Inthissectionwewilllookatseveralwaystowritetheequationofaline.Thespecificmethodweusewillbe

To graph the line, we will start at (−2, 1) and count out the rise −1 and the run 2. Then we draw the line.
Do the lines appear perpendicular? Does the second line pass through (−2, 1)?

HOW TO : :FIND AN EQUATION OF A LINE PERPENDICULAR TO A GIVEN LINE.
Step 1. Find the slope of the given line.
Step 2. Find the slope of the perpendicular line.
Step 3. Identify the point.
Step 4. Substitute the values into the point–slope form, y−y =m(x−x ).

Step 5. Write the equation in slope–intercept form.

form.
Solution
Again, since we know one point, the point–slope option seems more promising than the slope–intercept option. We
need the slope to use this form, and we know the new line will be perpendicular to x=5. This line is vertical, so its
perpendicular will be horizontal. This tells us the m =0.

HOW TO : :GRAPH A LINEAR INEQUALITY.
Step 1. Identify and graph the boundary line.
◦ If the inequality is ≤or≥ , the boundary line is solid.
◦ If the inequality is < or >, the boundary line is dashed.
Step 2. Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?
Step 3. Shade in one side of the boundary line.
◦ If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.
◦ If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.
EXAMPLE 4.73
Graph the linear inequality x−2y<5.
Solution
First we graph the boundary line x−2y=5. The inequality is < so we draw a dashed line.
Then we test a point. We’ll use (0, 0) again because it is easy to evaluate and it is not on the boundary line.
Is (0, 0) a solution of x−2y<5?
The point (0, 0) is a solution of x−2y<5, so we shade in that side of the boundary line.

Solution

so we draw a solid line.
Now, we need a test point. We can see that the point (1, 0) is not on the boundary line.
Is (1, 0) a solution of y≤−4x?

554 Chapter 4 Graphs
The point (1, 0) is not a solution to y≤−4x, so we shade in the opposite side of the boundary line. SeeFigure 4.35.

(0, 0) is not a solution to y>3.

Consistent and Inconsistent Systems
Aconsistent systemof equations is a system of equations with at least one solution.
Aninconsistent systemof equations is a system of equations with no solution.
We also categorize the equations in a system of equations by calling the equations independent or dependent. If two

Solution
Step 1. Readthe problem.
Step 2. Identifywhat we are looking for.
We are looking for the number of quarts of fruit juice and the number of quarts of club soda that Sondra will need.
Step 3. Namewhat we are looking for. Choose variables to represent those quantities.
Let f = number of quarts of fruit juice.

Step 4. Translateinto a system of equations.
⎧f +c=10
We now have the system. ⎨
⎩f =4c
Step 5. Solvethe system of equations using good algebra techniques.
The point of intersection (2, 8) is the solution. This means Sondra needs 2 quarts of club soda and 8 quarts of fruit juice.
Step 6. Checkthe answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Does this make sense in the problem?

what we’ll do with the elimination method, too, but we’ll have a different way to get there.
Solve a System of Equations by Elimination
TheEliminationMethodisbasedontheAdditionPropertyofEquality.TheAdditionPropertyofEqualitysaysthatwhen

Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal.
For any expressionsa,b,c, andd,
if a = b
and c = d
then a+c = b+d
To solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which
variablewillbeeasiesttoeliminate.Howdowedecide?Wewanttohavethecoefficientsofonevariablebeopposites,so
that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable.
Notice how that works when we add these two equations together:
3x+y=5
_2_x_−__y_=__0_
5x =5
They’s add to zero and we have one equation with one variable.
Let’s try another one:
⎧x+4y=2
⎨
⎩2x+5y=−2
This time we don’t see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations.

Now we see that the coefficients of thexterms are opposites, soxwill be eliminated when we add these two equations.

Wecanmakethecoefficientsofxbeoppositesifwemultiplythefirstequationby3andthesecondby−4,soweget12x
and −12x.
This gives us these two new equations:

When we add these equations,
⎧ 12x−9y=30
⎨
⎩−_1_2_x__−__2_0_y_=__2_8

thex’s are eliminated and we just have −29y= 58.

left St. Louis on the same route as Joni, driving 78 miles per hour. How long will it take Kelly to catch up to Joni?
Solution
A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation.

638 Chapter 5 Systems of Linear Equations
Identify and namewhat we are looking for.
A chart will help us organize the data.
We know the rates of both Joni and Kelly, and so
we enter them in the chart.
We are looking for the length of time Kelly,
k, and Joni,j, will each drive.
Since D=r·t we can fill in the Distance column.
Translateinto a system of equations.
To make the system of equations, we must recognize that Kelly and Joni will drive the same distance. So,
65j=78k.
Also, since Kelly left later, her time will be 1 hour less than Joni’s time.
2
So, k= j− 1 .
2
Now we have the system.
Solvethe system of equations by substitution.
Substitute k= j− 1 into the second equation, then solve forj.
2
To find Kelly’s time, substitutej= 3 into the first equation, then
solve fork.
Checkthe answer in the problem.
Joni 3 hours (65 mph) = 195 miles.
Kelly 2 1 hours (78 mph) = 195 miles.
2
Yes, they will have traveled the same distance
when they meet.
Answerthe question. Kelly will catch up to Joni in 2 1 hours.

By then, Joni will have traveled 3 hours.

Namewhat we are looking for. Let s= the rate of the ship in still water.
c= the rate of the current
A chart will help us organize the information.
The ship goes downstream and then upstream.
Going downstream, the current helps the
ship; therefore, the ship’s actual rate iss+c.
Going upstream, the current slows the ship;
therefore, the actual rate iss−c.
Downstream it takes 4 hours.
Upstream it takes 5 hours.
Each way the distance is 60 miles.

642 Chapter 5 Systems of Linear Equations
This is a uniform motion problem and a picture will help us visualize.
Identifywhat we are looking for. We are looking for the speed of the jet
in still air and the speed of the wind.
Namewhat we are looking for. Let j= the speed of the jet in still air.
w= the speed of the wind
A chart will help us organize the information.
The jet makes two trips-one in a tailwind
and one in a headwind.
In a tailwind, the wind helps the jet and so
the rate isj+w.
In a headwind, the wind slows the jet and
so the rate isj−w.
Each trip takes 3 hours.
In a tailwind the jet flies 1095 miles.
In a headwind the jet flies 987 miles.
Translateinto a system of equations.
Since rate times time is distance, we get the
system of equations.
Solvethe system of equations.
Distribute, then solve by elimination.
Add, and solve forj.
Substitutej= 347 into one of the original
equations, then solve forw.
Checkthe answer in the problem.
With the tailwind, the actual rate of the
jet would be
347 + 18 = 365 mph.
In 3 hours the jet would travel
365 · 3 = 1095 miles.
Going into the headwind, the jet’s actual
rate would be
347 − 18 = 329 mph.
In 3 hours the jet would travel
329 · 3 = 987 miles.

Chapter 5 Systems of Linear Equations 669
Solution
ⓐLet x= the number of small photos.
y= the number of large photos
To find the system of inequalities, translate the information.
She wants to have at least 25 photos.
The number of small plus the number of large should be at least 25.
x+y≥25
$4 for each small and $10 for each large must be no more than $200
4x+10y≤200
⎧x+y≥25
We have our system of inequalities. ⎨
⎩4x+10y≤200
ⓑ
To graph x+y≥25, graphx+y= 25 as a solid line.
Choose (0, 0) as a test point. Since it does not make
the inequality
true, shade the side that does not include the point (0,
0) red.
To graph 4x+10y≤200, graph 4x+ 10y= 200 as a
solid line.
Choose (0, 0) as a test point. Since it does not make
the inequality
true, shade the side that includes the point (0, 0) blue.
The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is double shaded and so is shaded darker.
ⓒTodetermineif10smalland20largephotoswouldwork,weseeifthepoint(10,20)isinthesolutionregion.

KEY CONCEPTS
5.1Solve Systems of Equations by Graphing
• To solve a system of linear equations by graphing
Step 1. Graph the first equation.
Step 2. Graph the second equation on the same rectangular coordinate system.
Step 3. Determine whether the lines intersect, are parallel, or are the same line.
Step 4. Identify the solution to the system.
If the lines intersect, identify the point of intersection. Check to make sure it is a solution to both
equations. This is the solution to the system.
If the lines are parallel, the system has no solution.
If the lines are the same, the system has an infinite number of solutions.
Step 5. Check the solution in both equations.

Determine the Degree of Polynomials
The degree of a polynomial and the degree of its terms are determined by the exponents of the variable.
Amonomialthat has no variable, just a constant, is a special case. The degree of a constant is 0—it has no variable.
Degree of a Polynomial
Thedegree of a termis the sum of the exponents of its variables.
Thedegree of a constantis 0.
Thedegree of a polynomialis the highest degree of all its terms.

Add and Subtract Monomials
You have learned how to simplify expressions by combining like terms. Remember, like terms must have the same
variables with the same exponent. Since monomials are terms, adding and subtracting monomials is the same as
combining like terms. If the monomials are like terms, we just combine them by adding or subtracting the coefficient.

Simplify Expressions Using the Product Property for Exponents
Youhaveseenthatwhenyoucombineliketermsbyaddingandsubtracting,youneedtohavethesamebasewiththe
sameexponent.Butwhenyoumultiplyanddivide,theexponentsmaybedifferent,andsometimesthebasesmaybe

We’ll derive the properties of exponents by looking for patterns in several examples.
First, we will look at an example that leads to the Product Property.
What does this mean?
How many factors altogether?
So, we have
Notice that 5 is the sum of the exponents, 2 and 3.
We write:
2 3
x ·x
2+3
x

x
The base stayed the same and we added the exponents. This leads to theProduct Property for Exponents.
Product Property for Exponents
If a is a real number, and mandn are counting numbers, then
m n m+n
a ·a =a
To multiply with like bases, add the exponents.
An example with numbers helps to verify this property.
2 3 ? 2+3
2 ·2 = 2

What does this mean? 2x·2x·2x
We group the like factors together. 2·2·2·x·x·x

Notice that each factor was raised to the power and (2x) 3 is 2 3 ·x 3.
We write: (2x) 3
3 3
2 ·x
The exponent applies to each of the factors! This leads to theProduct to a Power Property for Exponents.
Product to a Power Property for Exponents
If a and b are real numbers and m is a whole number, then
m m m
(ab) =a b
To raise a product to a power, raise each factor to that power.

Multiply a Polynomial by a Monomial
We have used the Distributive Property to simplify expressions like 2(x−3). You multiplied both terms in the
parentheses, xand3, by 2, to get 2x−6. With this chapter’s new vocabulary, you can say you were multiplying a
binomial, x−3, by a monomial, 2.

Now let’s do this same multiplication using the Vertical Method.
EXAMPLE 6.46
Multiply using the Vertical Method: (b+3)(2b 2 −5b+8).
Solution
It is easier to put the polynomial with fewer terms on the bottom because we get fewer partial products this way.
Multiply (2b2− 5b+ 8) by 3.
Multiply (2b2− 5b+ 8) by b.
Add like terms.

Square a Binomial Using the Binomial Squares Pattern
Mathematiciansliketolookforpatternsthatwillmaketheirworkeasier.Agoodexampleofthisissquaringbinomials.
Whileyoucanalwaysgettheproductbywritingthebinomialtwiceandusingthemethodsofthelastsection,thereisless
work to do if you learn to use a pattern.
Let's start by looking at (x+9)2.
What does this mean? (x+9)2
It means to multiply (x+9) by itself. (x+9)(x+9)
Then, using FOIL, we get: x 2 +9x+9x+81
Combining like terms gives: x 2 +18x+81
Here's another one: ⎛y−7⎞2
⎝ ⎠
Multiply ⎛y−7⎞ by itself. ⎛y−7⎞⎛y−7⎞
⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠
Using FOIL, we get: y 2 −7y−7y+49
And combining like terms: y 2 −14y+49
And one more: (2x+3)2
Multiply. (2x+3)(2x+3)
Use FOIL: 4x 2 +6x+6x+9
Combine like terms. 4x 2 +12x+9
Look at these results. Do you see any patterns?
What about the number of terms? In each example we squared a binomial and the result was atrinomial.

(a+b) =____+____+____
Now look at thefirst termin each result. Where did it come from?

the first term!
2 2
(a+b) =a +____+____
To get thefirst termof the product,square the first term.
Where did thelast termcome from? Look at the examples and find the pattern.
The last term is the product of the last terms, which is the square of the last term.
2 2
(a+b) =____+____+b
To get thelast termof the product,square the last term.
Finally,lookatthemiddleterm.Noticeitcamefromaddingthe“outer”andthe“inner”terms—whichareboththesame!
So the middle term is double the product of the two terms of the binomial.
2
(a+b) =____+2ab+____
2
(a−b) =____−2ab+____
To get themiddle termof the product,multiply the terms and double their product.
Putting it all together:

Multiply Conjugates Using the Product of Conjugates Pattern
Wejustsawapatternforsquaringbinomialsthatwecanusetomakemultiplyingsomebinomialseasier.Similarly,there
is a pattern for another product of binomials. But before we get to it, we need to introduce some vocabulary.
What do you notice about these pairs of binomials?

Look at the first term of eachbinomialin each pair.
Notice the first terms are the same in each pair.
Look at the last terms of each binomial in each pair.
Notice the last terms are the same in each pair.
Notice how each pair has one sum and one difference.
Apairofbinomialsthateachhavethesamefirsttermandthesamelastterm,butoneisasumandoneisadifference

To get thelast term, square the last term.
What do you observe about the products?
The product of the two binomials is also a binomial! Most of the products resulting from FOIL have been trinomials.
Whyistherenomiddleterm?NoticethetwomiddletermsyougetfromFOILcombineto0ineverycase,theresultofone

The product of conjugates is always of the form a 2 −b 2. This is called a difference of squares.
This leads to the pattern:
Product of Conjugates Pattern
If aandb are real numbers,
The product is called a difference of squares.
To multiply conjugates, square the first term, square the last term, and write the product as a difference of squares.
Let’s test this pattern with a numerical example.

Simplify Expressions Using the Quotient Property for Exponents
Earlier in this chapter, we developed the properties of exponents for multiplication. We summarize these properties
below.
Summary of Exponent Properties for Multiplication
If aandb are real numbers, and mandn are whole numbers, then
Product Property a m ·a n =a m+n
m n m·n
Power Property (a ) =a
m m m
Product to a Power (ab) =a b
Now we will look at the exponent properties for division. A quick memory refresher may help before we get started.
Youhavelearnedtosimplifyfractionsbydividingoutcommonfactorsfromthenumeratoranddenominatorusingthe
Equivalent Fractions Property. This property will also help you work with algebraic fractions—which are also quotients.
Equivalent Fractions Property
If a, b, andc are whole numbers where b≠0, c≠0,
a a·c a·c a
then = and =
b b·c b·c b
As before, we’ll try to discover a property by looking at some examples.

Zero Exponent
If a is a non-zero number, then a 0 =1.
Any nonzero number raised to the zero power is 1.
In this text, we assume any variable that we raise to the zero power is not zero.

Divide a Polynomial by a Binomial
Todivideapolynomialbyabinomial,wefollowaprocedureverysimilartolongdivisionofnumbers.Solet’slookcarefully
the steps we take when we divide a 3-digit number, 875, by a 2-digit number, 25.

768 Chapter 6 Polynomials
We write the long division
We divide the first two digits, 87, by 25.
We multiply 3 times 25 and write the product under the 87.
Now we subtract 75 from 87.
Then we bring down the third digit of the dividend, 5.
Repeat the process, dividing 25 into 125.
We check division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor.
If we did the division correctly, the product should equal the dividend.

HOW TO : :CONVERT FROM DECIMAL NOTATION TO SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
Step 1. Move the decimal point so that the first factor is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10.
Step 2. Count the number of decimal places,n, that the decimal point was moved.
Step 3. Write the number as a product with a power of 10.
If the original number is:
◦ greater than 1, the power of 10 will be 10n.
◦ between 0 and 1, the power of 10 will be 10−n.
Step 4. Check.
EXAMPLE 6.103
Write in scientific notation: 0.0052.
Solution
The original number, 0.0052, is between 0 and 1 so we will have a negative power of 10.

Greatest Common Factor
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions is the largest expression that is a factor of all the
expressions.
First we’ll find the GCF of two numbers.
EXAMPLE 7.1 HOW TO FIND THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR OF TWO OR MORE EXPRESSIONS
Find the GCF of 54 and 36.
Solution
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col31130/1.4

Chapter 7 Factoring 809
Notice that, because the GCF is a factor of both numbers, 54 and 36 can be written as multiples of 18.
54=18·3
36=18·2
TRY IT : :7.1 Find the GCF of 48 and 80.
TRY IT : :7.2 Find the GCF of 18 and 40.
We summarize the steps we use to find the GCF below.
HOW TO : :FIND THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR (GCF) OF TWO EXPRESSIONS.
Step 1. Factor each coefficient into primes. Write all variables with exponents in expanded form.
Step 2. List all factors—matching common factors in a column. In each column, circle the common
factors.
Step 3. Bring down the common factors that all expressions share.
Step 4. Multiply the factors.
In the first example, the GCF was a constant. In the next two examples, we will get variables in the greatest common
factor.

Factor Trinomials of the Formx +bx+cwithbNegative,cPositive
Intheexamplessofar,alltermsinthetrinomialwerepositive.Whathappenswhentherearenegativeterms?Well,it
depends which term is negative. Let’s look first at trinomials with only the middle term negative.
Remember: To get a negative sum and a positive product, the numbers must both be negative.
Again, think about FOIL and where each term in the trinomial came from. Just as before,
• the first term, x 2, comes from the product of the two first terms in each binomial factor,xandy;
• the positive last term is the product of the two last terms
• the negative middle term is the sum of the outer and inner terms.
How do you get apositive productand anegative sum? With two negative numbers.
EXAMPLE 7.20
Factor: t 2 −11t+28.
Solution
Again, with the positive last term, 28, and the negative middle term, −11t, we need two negative factors. Find two
numbers that multiply 28 and add to −11.

Let’ssummarizewherewearesofarwithfactoringpolynomials.Inthefirsttwosectionsofthischapter,weusedthree
methods of factoring: factoring the GCF, factoring by grouping, and factoring a trinomial by “undoing” FOIL. More
methods will follow as you continue in this chapter, as well as later in your studies of algebra.

As you start to factor a polynomial, always ask first, “Is there a greatest common factor?” If there is, factor it first.
Thenextthingtoconsideristhetypeofpolynomial.Howmanytermsdoesithave?Isitabinomial?Atrinomial?Ordoes

Chapter 7 Factoring 835
HOW TO : :CHOOSE A STRATEGY TO FACTOR POLYNOMIALS COMPLETELY.
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor?
◦ Factor it out.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
◦ If it is a binomial, right now we have no method to factor it.
◦ If it is a trinomial of the form x 2 +bx+c: Undo FOIL (x )(x )
◦ If it has more than three terms: Use the grouping method.
Step 3. Check by multiplying the factors.
Use the preliminary strategy to completely factor a polynomial. A polynomial is factored completely if, other than
monomials, all of its factors are prime.

Check. Does 1x·3x=3x 2?
We know the last terms of the binomials will multiply to 2. Since this trinomial has all positive terms, we only need to
consider positive factors. The only factors of 2 are 1 and 2. But we now have two cases to consider as it will make a
difference if we write 1, 2, or 2, 1.

Step 1. Write the trinomial in descending order of degrees.
Step 2. Find all the factor pairs of the first term.
Step 3. Find all the factor pairs of the third term.
Step 4. Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found.
Step 5. Check by multiplying.
When the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomials must both be negative.
EXAMPLE 7.34
Factor completely: 6b 2 −13b+5.
Solution
The trinomial is already in descending order.
Find the factors of the first term.
Find the factors of the last term. Consider the signs. Since the last term, 5 is positive its
factors must both be positive or both be negative. The coefficient of the middle term is
negative, so we use the negative factors.
Consider all the combinations of factors.

848 Chapter 7 Factoring
HOW TO : :CHOOSE A STRATEGY TO FACTOR POLYNOMIALS COMPLETELY (UPDATED).
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor?
◦ Factor it.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
◦ If it is a binomial, right now we have no method to factor it.
◦ If it is a trinomial of the form x 2 +bx+c
Undo FOIL (x )(x ).
◦ If it is a trinomial of the form ax 2 +bx+c
Use Trial and Error or the “ac” method.
◦ If it has more than three terms
Use the grouping method.
Step 3. Check by multiplying the factors.

870 Chapter 7 Factoring
HOW TO : :FACTOR POLYNOMIALS.
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor?
◦ Factor it out.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
◦ If it is a binomial:
Is it a sum?
▪ Of squares? Sums of squares do not factor.
▪ Of cubes? Use the sum of cubes pattern.
Is it a difference?
▪ Of squares? Factor as the product of conjugates.
▪ Of cubes? Use the difference of cubes pattern.
◦ If it is a trinomial:
Is it of the form x 2 +bx+c? Undo FOIL.
Is it of the form ax 2 +bx+c?
▪ If a and c are squares, check if it fits the trinomial square pattern.
▪ Use the trial and error or “ac” method.
◦ If it has more than three terms:
Use the grouping method.
Step 3. Check.
◦ Is it factored completely?
◦ Do the factors multiply back to the original polynomial?
Remember, a polynomial is completely factored if, other than monomials, its factors are prime!

KEY CONCEPTS
7.1Greatest Common Factor and Factor by Grouping
• Finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF):To find the GCF of two expressions:
Step 1. Factor each coefficient into primes. Write all variables with exponents in expanded form.
Step 2. List all factors—matching common factors in a column. In each column, circle the common factors.
Step 3. Bring down the common factors that all expressions share.
Step 4. Multiply the factors as inExample 7.2.
• FactortheGreatestCommonFactorfromaPolynomial:Tofactoragreatestcommonfactorfromapolynomial:
Step 1. Find the GCF of all the terms of the polynomial.
Step 2. Rewrite each term as a product using the GCF.
Step 3. Use the ‘reverse’ Distributive Property to factor the expression.
Step 4. Check by multiplying the factors as inExample 7.5.
• Factor by Grouping:To factor a polynomial with 4 four or more terms
Step 1. Group terms with common factors.
Step 2. Factor out the common factor in each group.
Step 3. Factor the common factor from the expression.
Step 4. Check by multiplying the factors as inExample 7.15.
7.2Factor Trinomials of the Form x2+bx+c
• Factor trinomials of the form x 2 +bx+c
Step 1. Write the factors as two binomials with first termsx: (x )(x ).
Step 2. Find two numbersmandnthat
Multiply toc, m·n=c
Add tob, m+n=b

896 Chapter 7 Factoring
Step 3. Usemandnas the last terms of the factors: (x+m)(x+n).
Step 4. Check by multiplying the factors.
7.3Factor Trinomials of the Form ax2+bx+c
• Factor Trinomials of the Form ax 2 +bx+c using Trial and Error:SeeExample 7.33.
Step 1. Write the trinomial in descending order of degrees.
Step 2. Find all the factor pairs of the first term.
Step 3. Find all the factor pairs of the third term.
Step 4. Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found.
Step 5. Check by multiplying.
• Factor Trinomials of the Form ax 2 +bx+c Using the “ac” Method:SeeExample 7.38.
Step 1. Factor any GCF.
Step 2. Find the product ac.
Step 3. Find two numbersmandnthat:
Multiply toac m·n=a·c
Add tob m+n=b
Step 4. Split the middle term usingmandn:
Step 5. Factor by grouping.
Step 6. Check by multiplying the factors.
• Choose a strategy to factor polynomials completely (updated):
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor? Factor it.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
If it is a binomial, right now we have no method to factor it.
If it is a trinomial of the form x 2 +bx+c
Undo FOIL (x )(x ).
If it is a trinomial of the form ax 2 +bx+c
Use Trial and Error or the “ac” method.
If it has more than three terms
Use the grouping method.
Step 3. Check by multiplying the factors.

• General Strategy for Factoring Polynomials SeeFigure 7.4.
• How to Factor Polynomials
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor? Factor it out.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
▪ If it is a binomial:
Is it a sum?
▪ Of squares? Sums of squares do not factor.
▪ Of cubes? Use the sum of cubes pattern.
Is it a difference?
▪ Of squares? Factor as the product of conjugates.
▪ Of cubes? Use the difference of cubes pattern.
▪ If it is a trinomial:
Is it of the form x 2 +bx+c? Undo FOIL.
Is it of the form ax 2 +bx+c?
▪ If ‘a’ and ‘c’ are squares, check if it fits the trinomial square pattern.
▪ Use the trial and error or ‘ac’ method.
▪ If it has more than three terms:
Use the grouping method.
Step 3. Check. Is it factored completely? Do the factors multiply back to the original polynomial?
7.6Quadratic Equations
• Zero Product PropertyIf a·b=0, then either a=0 or b=0 or both. SeeExample 7.69.
• Solve a quadratic equation by factoringTo solve a quadratic equation by factoring: SeeExample 7.73.

We will perform same operations with rational expressions that we do with fractions. We will simplify, add, subtract,
multiply, divide, and use them in applications.
Determine the Values for Which a Rational Expression is Undefined
When we work with a numerical fraction, it is easy to avoid dividing by zero, because we can see the number in the
denominator.Inordertoavoiddividingbyzeroinarationalexpression,wemustnotallowvaluesofthevariablethatwill
make the denominator be zero.
Ifthedenominatoriszero,therationalexpressionisundefined.Thenumeratorofarationalexpressionmaybe0—but
not the denominator.
Sobeforewebeginanyoperationwitharationalexpression,weexamineitfirsttofindthevaluesthatwouldmakethe

HOW TO : :DETERMINE THE VALUES FOR WHICH A RATIONAL EXPRESSION IS UNDEFINED.
Step 1. Set the denominator equal to zero.
Step 2. Solve the equation in the set of reals, if possible.

Multiply Rational Expressions
To multiply rational expressions, we do just what we did with numerical fractions. We multiply the numerators and
multiply the denominators. Then, if there are any common factors, we remove them to simplify the result.
Multiplication of Rational Expressions
If p, q, r, s are polynomials where q≠0ands≠0, then
p r pr
· =
q s qs
To multiply rational expressions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
We’ll do the first example with numerical fractions to remind us of how we multiplied fractions without variables.

Add Rational Expressions with a Common Denominator
What is the first step you take when you add numerical fractions? You check if they have a common denominator. If
they do, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. If they do not have a common
denominator, you find one before you add.
Itisthesamewithrationalexpressions.Toaddrationalexpressions,theymusthaveacommondenominator.Whenthe
denominators are the same, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator.

To subtract rational expressions, subtract the numerators and place the difference over the common denominator.
We always simplify rational expressions. Be sure to factor, if possible, after you subtract the numerators so you can
identify any common factors.

Finally, we solved that equation.

Solve Proportions
When two rational expressions are equal, the equation relating them is called aproportion.
Proportion

Aproportionis an equation of the form = , where b≠0, d ≠0.

Suppose a school principal wants to have 1 teacher for 20 students. She could use proportions to find the number of
teachers for 60 students. We letxbe the number of teachers for 60 students and then set up the proportion:
1teacher xteachers
=
20students 60students
We are careful to match the units of the numerators and the units of the denominators—teachers in the numerators,
students in the denominators.
Sinceaproportionisanequationwithrationalexpressions,wewillsolveproportionsthesamewaywesolvedequations

Solution
This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation.

Chapter 8 Rational Expressions and Equations 1001
We fill in the chart to organize the information.
We are looking for the speed of the airplane. Let r = the speed of the airplane.
When the plane flies with the wind, the wind
increases its speed and the rate is r+30.
When the plane flies against the wind, the wind
decreases its speed and the rate is r−30.
Write in the rates.
Write in the distances.
Since D=r ∙t , we solve fortand get D.
r
We divide the distance by the rate in each row, and
place the expression in the time column.
We know the times are equal and so we write our 200 300
=
equation. r−30 r+30
We multiply both sides by the LCD. ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎛ 200 ⎞ ⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞⎛ 300 ⎞
r+30 r−30 = r+30 r−30
200(r+30)=300(r−30) ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠⎝r−30⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠⎝r+30⎠
Simplify. (r+30)(200)=(r−30)(300)
200r+6000=300r−9000
15000=100r
Solve.
150=r
Check.
Is 150 mph a reasonable speed for an airplane? Yes.
If the plane is traveling 150 mph and the wind is 30
mph:
Tailwind 150+30=180mph 300 = 5 hours
180 3
Headwind 150−30=120mph 200 = 5 hours
120 3
The times are equal, so it checks. The plane was traveling 150 mph.

Solution
This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation.
We fill in the chart to organize the information.
We are looking for Jazmine’s running speed. Let r = Jazmine’s running speed.
Her biking speed is 4 miles faster than her running speed. r+4= her biking speed
The distances are given, enter them into the chart.
Since D=r ∙t , we solve fortand get t= D.
r
We divide the distance by the rate in each row, and place the expression
in the time column.

Check. r = − 4 r =8

A negative speed does not make sense in this problem, so r =8 is the
solution.
Is 8 mph a reasonable running speed? Yes.

Simplify Expressions with Square Roots
Rememberthatwhenanumber n ismultipliedbyitself,wewrite n 2 andreadit“nsquared.”Forexample, 15 2 reads
as “15 squared,” and 225 is called the square of 15, since 15 2 =225.
Square of a Number
If n 2 =m, then m is the square of n.
Sometimeswewillneedtolookattherelationshipbetweennumbersandtheirsquaresinreverse.Because225isthe
square of 15, we can also say that 15 is a square root of 225. A number whose square is m is called asquare rootof m.
Square Root of a Number
If n 2 =m, then n is a square root of m.
Notice (−15)2 =225 also, so −15 is also a square root of 225. Therefore, both 15 and −15 are square roots of 225.
So, every positive number has two square roots—one positive and one negative. What if we only wanted the positive

In the last section, we estimated the square root of a number between two consecutive whole numbers. We can say
that 50 is between 7 and 8. This is fairly easy to do when the numbers are small enough that we can use m82545
(http://cnx.org/content/m82545/1.3/#CNX_ElemAlg_Figure_09_01_003).
Butwhatifwewanttoestimate 500?Ifwesimplifythesquarerootfirst,we’llbeabletoestimateiteasily.Thereare
other reasons, too, to simplify square roots as you’ll see later in this chapter.
A square root is consideredsimplifiedif its radicand contains no perfect square factors.
Simplified Square Root
a is considered simplified if a has no perfect square factors.
So 31 is simplified. But 32 is not simplified, because 16 is a perfect square factor of 32.
Use the Product Property to Simplify Square Roots

that (ab) m =a m b m. The corresponding property of square roots says that ab= a· b.
Product Property of Square Roots

Whenever you have to simplify a square root, the first step you should take is to determine whether the radicand is
a perfect square. A perfect square fraction is a fraction in which both the numerator and the denominator are perfect
squares.

Multiply Square Roots
WehaveusedtheProductPropertyofSquareRootstosimplifysquarerootsbyremovingtheperfectsquarefactors.The
Product Property of Square Roots says
ab= a· b
We can use the Product Property of Square Roots ‘in reverse’ to multiply square roots.
a· b= ab
Remember, we assume all variables are greater than or equal to zero.
We will rewrite the Product Property of Square Roots so we see both ways together.
Product Property of Square Roots
Ifa,bare nonnegative real numbers, then
ab= a· b and a· b= ab
So we can multiply 3· 5 in this way:

Similarly, a square root is not considered simplified if the radicand contains a fraction.

A square root is considered simplified if there are
• no perfect-square factors in the radicand
• no fractions in the radicand
• no square roots in the denominator of a fraction

equation x 2 =9.
2
x = 9
2
Put the equation in standard form. x −9 = 0
Factor the left side. (x−3)(x+3) = 0
Use the Zero Product Property. (x−3)=0, (x+3) = 0
Solve each equation. x=3, x = −3
Combine the two solutions into ± form. x = ±3
(The solution is read‘xis equal to positive or negative 3.’)

solve the equation by factoring.
These equations are all of the form x 2 =k.
We defined the square root of a number in this way:
2
Ifn =m, thennis a square root ofm.
This leads to theSquare Root Property.

If x 2 =k, and k≥0, then x= korx=− k.

k and its opposite. We could also write the solution as x= ± k.
Now, we will solve the equation x 2 =9 again, this time using the Square Root Property.
2
x = 9
Use the Square Root Property. x = ± 9
Simplify the radical. x = ±3
Rewrite to show the two solutions. x=3, x = −3
What happens when the constant is not a perfect square? Let’s use the Square Root Property to solve the equation
x 2 =7.
2
x = 7
Use the Square Root Property. x = ± 7
Rewrite to show two solutions. x= 7, x=− 7
We cannot simplify 7, so we leave the answer as a radical.

Identify the Most Appropriate Method to Use to Solve a Quadratic Equation
We have used four methods to solve quadratic equations:
• Factoring
• Square Root Property
• Completing the Square
• Quadratic Formula
You can solve any quadratic equation by using the Quadratic Formula, but that is not always the easiest method to use.
HOW TO : :IDENTIFY THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD TO SOLVE A QUADRATIC EQUATION.
Step 1. TryFactoringfirst. If the quadratic factors easily, this method is very quick.
Step 2. TrytheSquareRootPropertynext.Iftheequationfitstheform ax 2 =k or a(x−h)2 =k,
it can easily be solved by using the Square Root Property.
Step 3. Use the Quadratic Formula. Any quadratic equation can be solved by using the Quadratic
Formula.

Find the Intercepts of a Parabola
When we graphed linear equations, we often used the x- and y-intercepts to help us graph the lines. Finding the
coordinates of the intercepts will help us to graph parabolas, too.
Remember, at they-interceptthe value of x is zero. So, to find they-intercept, we substitute x=0 into the equation.
Let’s find they-intercepts of the two parabolas shown in the figure below.
Figure 10.5
Atanx-intercept,thevalueof y iszero.Tofindanx-intercept,wesubstitute y=0 intotheequation.Inotherwords,
we will need to solve the equation 0=ax 2 +bx+c for x.

But solving quadratic equations like this is exactly what we have done earlier in this chapter.
We can now find thex-intercepts of the two parabolas shown inFigure 10.5.
First, we will find thex-intercepts of a parabolawith equation y= x 2 +4x+3.
Let y=0.

Now, we will find thex-intercepts of the parabola with equation y= −x 2 +4x+3.
Let y=0.

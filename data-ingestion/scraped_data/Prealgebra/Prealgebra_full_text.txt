of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly related to previous topics.
Chapter 1: Whole Numbers
Each of the four basic operations with whole numbers—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—is
modeled and explained. As each operation is covered, discussions of algebraic notation and operation signs,
translation of algebraic expressions into word phrases, and the use the operation in applications are included.
Chapter 2: The Language of Algebra
Mathematical vocabulary as it applies to the whole numbers is presented. The use of variables, which
distinguishes algebra from arithmetic, is introduced early in the chapter, and the development of and practice
with arithmetic concepts use variables as well as numeric expressions. In addition, the difference between
expressions and equations is discussed, word problems are introduced, and the process for solving one-step
equations is modeled.

Chapter 3: Integers
While introducing the basic operations with negative numbers, students continue to practice simplifying,
evaluating,andtranslatingalgebraicexpressions.TheDivisionPropertyofEqualityisintroducedandusedtosolve
one-step equations.
Chapter 4: Fractions
Fraction circles and bars are used to help make fractions real and to develop operations on them. Students
continue simplifying and evaluating algebraic expressions with fractions, and learn to use the Multiplication
Property of Equality to solve equations involving fractions.
Chapter 5: Decimals

Chapter 6: Percents
Conversions among percents, fractions, and decimals are explored. Applications of percent include calculating
sales tax, commission, and simple interest. Proportions and solving percent equations as proportions are
addressed as well.

A gradual build-up to solving multi-step equations is presented. Problems involve solving equations with
constantsonbothsides,variablesonbothsides,variablesandconstantsonbothsides,andfractionanddecimal
coefficients.
Chapter 9: Math Models and Geometry
The chapter begins with opportunities to solve “traditional” number, coin, and mixture problems. Geometry
sections cover the properties of triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, circles, irregular figures, the Pythagorean
Theorem, and volumes and surface areas of solids. Distance-rate-time problems and formulas are included as
well.

Narrative text
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide
transitions between topics and examples. An informal voice was used to make the content accessible to students.
Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:
Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.
Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.
Examples
Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving

Introduction
Even though counting is first taught at a young age, mastering mathematics, which is the study of numbers, requires
constant attention. If it has been a while since you have studied math, it can be helpful to review basic topics. In
this chapter, we will focus on numbers used for counting as well as four arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. We will also discuss some vocabulary that we will use throughout this book.
1.1 Introduction to Whole Numbers
Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Identify counting numbers and whole numbers
Model whole numbers
Identify the place value of a digit
Use place value to name whole numbers
Use place value to write whole numbers
Round whole numbers

1.7. Suppose we want to round the number 76 to the nearest ten. Is 76 closer to 70 or 80 on the number line?
Figure 1.7 We can see that 76 is closer to 80 than to 70. So 76 rounded to the nearest ten is 80.
Now consider the number 72. Find 72 inFigure 1.8.
Figure 1.8 We can see that 72 is closer to 70, so 72 rounded to the nearest ten is 70.
How do we round 75 to the nearest ten. Find 75 inFigure 1.9.

HOW TO : :ROUND A WHOLE NUMBER TO A SPECIFIC PLACE VALUE.
Step 1. Locate the given place value. All digits to the left of that place value do not change.
Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the given place value.
Step 3. Determine if this digit is greater than or equal to 5.
◦ Yes—add 1 to the digit in the given place value.
◦ No—do not change the digit in the given place value.
Step 4. Replace all digits to the right of the given place value with zeros.
EXAMPLE 1.8
Round 843 to the nearest ten.
Solution
Locate the tens place.
Underline the digit to the right of the tens place.
Since 3 is less than 5, do not change the digit in the tens
place.
Replace all digits to the right of the tens place with zeros.
Rounding 843 to the nearest ten gives
840.
TRY IT : :1.15 Round to the nearest ten: 157.

18 Chapter 1 Whole Numbers
Solution
ⓐ
Locate the hundreds place.
The digit of the right of the hundreds place is 5. Underline the digit to the right
of the hundreds place.
Since 5 is greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding 1 to the digit in the
hundreds place. Then replace all digits to the right of the hundreds place with
zeros.
So 23,658 rounded to
the nearest hundred is
23,700.
ⓑ
Locate the hundreds place.
Underline the digit to the right of the hundreds place.
The digit to the right of the hundreds place is 7. Since 7 is
greater than or equal to 5, round up by added 1 to the 9. Then
place all digits to the right of the hundreds place with zeros.
So 3,978 rounded to the nearest
hundred is 4,000.
TRY IT : :1.17 Round to the nearest hundred: 17,852.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers 19
Solution
ⓐ
Locate the thousands place. Underline the digit to the right of the
thousands place.
The digit to the right of the thousands place is 0. Since 0 is less than 5,
we do not change the digit in the thousands place.
We then replace all digits to the right of the thousands pace with zeros.
So 147,032 rounded to the
nearest thousand is 147,000.
ⓑ
Locate the thousands place.
Underline the digit to the right of the thousands place.
The digit to the right of the thousands place is 5. Since 5 is
greater than or equal to 5, round up by adding 1 to the 9. Then
replace all digits to the right of the thousands place with zeros.
So 29,504 rounded to the nearest

Add Whole Numbers Without Models
Now that we have used models to add numbers, we can move on to adding without models. Before we do that, make sure
you know all the one digit addition facts. You will need to use these number facts when you add larger numbers.
Imagine filling in Table 1.1 by adding each row number along the left side to each column number across the top. Make
sure that you get each sum shown. If you have trouble, model it. It is important that you memorize any number facts you
do not already know so that you can quickly and reliably use the number facts when you add larger numbers.

Did you notice what happens when you add zero to a number? The sum of any number and zero is the number itself. We
call this the Identity Property of Addition. Zero is called the additive identity.
Identity Property of Addition
The sum of any number a and 0 is the number.

Remember a block represents 1 and a rod represents 10. Let’s start by modeling the subtraction expression we just
considered, 7−3.
We start by modeling the first number, 7.
Now take away the second number, 3. We'll circle 3 blocks to show that we are
taking them away.
Count the number of blocks remaining.
We have shown that
There are 4 ones blocks left.
7−3=4.
MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Model Subtraction of Whole Numbers will help you develop a better
understanding of subtracting whole numbers.
EXAMPLE 1.27
Model the subtraction: 8−2.
Solution
8−2 means the difference of 8 and 2.
Model the first, 8.
Take away the second number, 2.
Count the number of blocks remaining.
There are 6 ones blocks left. We have shown that 8−2=6.

42 Chapter 1 Whole Numbers
Solution
Model the first number, 13. We use 1 ten and 3 ones.
Take away the second number, 8. However, there are not 8 ones,
so we will exchange the 1 ten for 10 ones.
Now we can take away 8 ones.
Count the blocks remaining.
There are five ones left. We have shown that 13−8=5.
As we did with addition, we can describe the models as ones blocks and tens rods, or we can simply say ones and tens.
TRY IT : :1.55 Model the subtraction: 12−7.
TRY IT : :1.56 Model the subtraction: 14−8.
EXAMPLE 1.29
Model the subtraction: 43−26.
Solution
Because 43−26 means 43 take away 26, we begin by modeling the 43.
Now, we need to take away 26, which is 2 tens and 6 ones. We cannot take away 6 ones from 3 ones. So, we
exchange 1 ten for 10 ones.
Now we can take away 2 tens and 6 ones.
Count the number of blocks remaining. There is 1 ten and 7 ones, which is 17.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11756/1.9

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers 45
Solution
Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.
Subtract the ones. We cannot subtract 6 from 3, so we borrow 1 ten. This makes 3 tens and 13
ones. We write these numbers above each place and cross out the original digits.
Now we can subtract the ones. 13−6=7. We write the 7 in the ones place in the difference.
Now we subtract the tens. 3−2=1. We write the 1 in the tens place in the difference.

Solution
Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.
Subtract the ones. 7−4=3.
Write the 3 in the ones place in the difference. Write the 3 in the ones place in the difference.
Subtract the tens. We cannot subtract 6 from 0 so we borrow 1 hundred and add 10 tens to
the 0 tens we had. This makes a total of 10 tens. We write 10 above the tens place and cross
out the 0. Then we cross out the 2 in the hundreds place and write 1 above it.
Now we subtract the tens. 10−6=4. We write the 4 in the tens place in the difference.
Finally, subtract the hundreds. There is no digit in the hundreds place in the bottom number
so we can imagine a 0 in that place. Since 1−0=1, we write 1 in the hundreds place in the
difference.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers 47
Solution
Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.
Subtract the ones. We cannot subtract 6 from 0, so we borrow 1 ten and add 10 ones to the
10 ones we had. This makes 10 ones. We write a 0 above the tens place and cross out the 1.
We write the 10 above the ones place and cross out the 0. Now we can subtract the ones.
10−6=4.
Write the 4 in the ones place of the difference.
Subtract the tens. We cannot subtract 8 from 0, so we borrow 1 hundred and add 10 tens to
the 0 tens we had, which gives us 10 tens. Write 8 above the hundreds place and cross out
the 9. Write 10 above the tens place.
Now we can subtract the tens. 10−8=2.
Subtract the hundreds place. 8−5=3 Write the 3 in the hundreds place in the difference.

Solution
Write the numbers so each place values line up vertically.
Subtract the ones. Since we cannot subtract 9 from 2, borrow 1 ten and add 10 ones to the 2
ones to make 12 ones. Write 5 above the tens place and cross out the 6. Write 12 above the
ones place and cross out the 2.
Now we can subtract the ones. 12−9=3
Write 3 in the ones place in the difference.
Subtract the tens. Since we cannot subtract 7 from 5, borrow 1 hundred and add 10 tens to
the 5 tens to make 15 tens. Write 0 above the hundreds place and cross out the 1. Write 15
above the tens place.
Now we can subtract the tens. 15−7=8
Write 8 in the tens place in the difference.
Now we can subtract the hundreds.
Write 6 in the hundreds place in the difference.
Subtract the thousands. There is no digit in the thousands place of the bottom number, so
we imagine a 0. 1−0=1. Write 1 in the thousands place of the difference.

to line up the place values.
HOW TO : :MULTIPLY TWO WHOLE NUMBERS TO FIND THE PRODUCT.
Step 1. Write the numbers so each place value lines up vertically.
Step 2. Multiply the digits in each place value.
◦ Work from right to left, starting with the ones place in the bottom number.
▪ Multiplythebottomnumberbytheonesdigitinthetopnumber,thenbythe
tens digit, and so on.
▪ If a product in a place value is more than 9, carry to the next place value.
▪ Write the partial products, lining up the digits in the place values with the
numbers above.
◦ Repeat for the tens place in the bottom number, the hundreds place, and so on.
◦ Insert a zero as a placeholder with each additional partial product.
Step 3. Add the partial products.
EXAMPLE 1.46
Multiply: 62(87).

62 Chapter 1 Whole Numbers
Solution
Write the numbers so each place lines up vertically.
Start by multiplying 7 by 62. Multiply 7 by the digit in the ones place of 62. 7⋅2=14. Write the 4
in the ones place of the product and carry the 1 to the tens place.
Multiply 7 by the digit in the tens place of 62. 7⋅6=42. Add the 1 ten we carried. 42+1=43.
Write the 3 in the tens place of the product and the 4 in the hundreds place.
The first partial product is 434.
Now, write a 0 under the 4 in the ones place of the next partial product as a placeholder since we
now multiply the digit in the tens place of 87 by 62. Multiply 8 by the digit in the ones place of 62.
8⋅2=16. Write the 6 in the next place of the product, which is the tens place. Carry the 1 to the
tens place.
Multiply 8 by 6, the digit in the tens place of 62, then add the 1 ten we carried to get 49. Write the 9
in the hundreds place of the product and the 4 in the thousands place.
The second partial product is 4960. Add the partial products.
The product is 5,394.

Divide Whole Numbers
We said that addition and subtraction are inverse operations because one undoes the other. Similarly, division is the
inverse operation of multiplication. We know 12÷4=3 because 3·4=12. Knowing all the multiplication number
facts is very important when doing division.
We check our answer to division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor to determine if it equals the dividend. In
Example 1.57, we know 24÷8=3 is correct because 3·8=24.

Divide the first digit of the dividend, 7, by the divisor, 3.
The divisor 3 can go into 7 two times since 2×3=6. Write the 2 above the 7 in the quotient.
Multiply the 2 in the quotient by 2 and write the product, 6, under the 7.
Subtract that product from the first digit in the dividend. Subtract 7−6. Write the difference,

HOW TO : :DIVIDE WHOLE NUMBERS.
Step 1. Divide the first digit of the dividend by the divisor.
If the divisor is larger than the first digit of the dividend, divide the first two digits of the
dividend by the divisor, and so on.
Step 2. Write the quotient above the dividend.
Step 3. Multiply the quotient by the divisor and write the product under the dividend.
Step 4. Subtract that product from the dividend.
Step 5. Bring down the next digit of the dividend.
Step 6. Repeat from Step 1 until there are no more digits in the dividend to bring down.
Step 7. Check by multiplying the quotient times the divisor.

80 Chapter 1 Whole Numbers
EXAMPLE 1.61
Divide 2,596÷4. Check by multiplying:
Solution
Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division.
Divide the first digit of the dividend, 2, by the divisor, 4.
Since 4 does not go into 2, we use the first two digits of the dividend and divide 25 by 4. The
divisor 4 goes into 25 six times.
We write the 6 in the quotient above the 5.
Multiply the 6 in the quotient by the divisor 4 and write the product, 24, under the first two
digits in the dividend.
Subtract that product from the first two digits in the dividend. Subtract 25−24. Write the
difference, 1, under the second digit in the dividend.
Now bring down the 9 and repeat these steps. There are 4 fours in 19. Write the 4 over the 9.
Multiply the 4 by 4 and subtract this product from 19.
Bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There are 9 fours in 36. Write the 9 over the 6.
Multiply the 9 by 4 and subtract this product from 36.
So 2,596÷4=649.
Check by multiplying.

Solution
Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division.
First we try to divide 6 into 4.
Since that won't work, we try 6 into 45.
There are 7 sixes in 45. We write the 7 over the 5.
Multiply the 7 by 6 and subtract this product from 45.
Now bring down the 0 and repeat these steps. There are 5 sixes in 30.
Write the 5 over the 0. Multiply the 5 by 6 and subtract this product from 30.
Now bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There is 1 six in 6.
Write the 1 over the 6. Multiply 1 by 6 and subtract this product from 6.
Check by multiplying.
It equals the dividend, so our answer is correct.

Since that won't work, we try 9 into 72. There are 8 nines in 72.
We write the 8 over the 2.
Multiply the 8 by 9 and subtract this product from 72.
Now bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There are 0 nines in 6.
Write the 0 over the 6. Multiply the 0 by 9 and subtract this product from 6.
Now bring down the 3 and repeat these steps. There are 7 nines in 63. Write the 7 over the 3.
Multiply the 7 by 9 and subtract this product from 63.
Check by multiplying.
It equals the dividend, so our answer is correct.

EXAMPLE 1.64
Divide 1,439÷4. Check by multiplying.
Solution
Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division.
First we try to divide 4 into 1. Since that won't work, we try 4 into 14.
There are 3 fours in 14. We write the 3 over the 4.
Multiply the 3 by 4 and subtract this product from 14.
Now bring down the 3 and repeat these steps. There are 5 fours in 23.
Write the 5 over the 3. Multiply the 5 by 4 and subtract this product from 23.
Now bring down the 9 and repeat these steps. There are 9 fours in 39.
Write the 9 over the 9. Multiply the 9 by 4 and subtract this product from 39.
There are no more numbers to bring down, so we are done.
The remainder is 3.
Check by multiplying.
So 1,439÷4 is 359 with a remainder of 3. Our answer is correct.

Divide and then check by multiplying: 1,461÷13.
Solution
Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division. 131,461
First we try to divide 13 into 1. Since that won't work, we try 13 into 14.
There is 1 thirteen in 14. We write the 1 over the 4.
Multiply the 1 by 13 and subtract this product from 14.
Now bring down the 6 and repeat these steps. There is 1 thirteen in 16.
Write the 1 over the 6. Multiply the 1 by 13 and subtract this product from 16.
Now bring down the 1 and repeat these steps. There are 2 thirteens in 31.
Write the 2 over the 1. Multiply the 2 by 13 and subtract this product from 31. There
are no more numbers to bring down, so we are done.
The remainder is 5. 1,462÷13 is 112 with a remainder of 5.
Check by multiplying.
Our answer is correct.
TRY IT : :1.129 Divide. Then check by multiplying: 1,493÷13.

Chapter 1 Whole Numbers 85
Solution
Let's rewrite the problem to set it up for long division. 24174,521
First we try to divide 241 into 7. Since that won’t work, we try 241 into 74. That still
won’t work, so we try 241 into 745. Since 2 divides into 7 three times, we try 3.
Since 3×241=723, we write the 3 over the 5 in 745.
Note that 4 would be too large because 4×241=964, which is greater than 745.
Multiply the 3 by 241 and subtract this product from 745.
Now bring down the 2 and repeat these steps. 241 does not divide into 222.
We write a 0 over the 2 as a placeholder and then continue.
Now bring down the 1 and repeat these steps. Try 9. Since 9×241=2,169,
we write the 9 over the 1. Multiply the 9 by 241 and subtract this product from
2,221.
There are no more numbers to bring down, so we are finished. The remainder is 52.
So 74,521÷241
is 309 with a remainder of 52.
Check by multiplying.

Use Variables and Algebraic Symbols
GregandAlexhavethesamebirthday,buttheywerebornindifferentyears.ThisyearGregis 20 yearsoldandAlexis
23, soAlexis 3 yearsolderthanGreg.WhenGregwas 12, Alexwas 15. WhenGregis 35, Alexwillbe 38. No
matter what Greg’s age is, Alex’s age will always be 3 years more, right?
In the language of algebra, we say that Greg’s age and Alex’s age are variable and the three is a constant. The ages
change, or vary, so age is a variable. The 3 years between them always stays the same, so the age difference is the
constant.
In algebra, letters of the alphabet are used to represent variables. Suppose we call Greg’s age g. Then we could use
g+3 to represent Alex’s age. SeeTable 2.1.
Greg’s age Alex’s age

Letters are used to represent variables. Letters often used for variables are x, y, a, b, andc.
Variables and Constants
A variable is a letter that represents a number or quantity whose value may change.
A constant is a number whose value always stays the same.

When two quantities have the same value, we say they are equal and connect them with anequal sign.
Equality Symbol

104 Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra
The symbol = is called theequal sign.

knowthat b isgreaterthan a, itmeansthat b istotherightof a onthenumberline.Weusethesymbols “<” and
“>” for inequalities.
Inequality
a<b is read a is less than b
a is to the left of b on the number line
a>b is read a is greater than b
a is to the right of b on the number line
The expressions a < b and a > b can be read from left-to-right or right-to-left, though in English we usually read from
left-to-right. In general,
a < b is equivalent to b > a. For example, 7 < 11 is equivalent to 11 > 7.
a > b is equivalent to b < a. For example, 17 > 4 is equivalent to 4 < 17.
When we write an inequality symbol with a line under it, such as a ≤ b, it means a < b or a = b. We read this a is
less than or equal to b. Also, if we put a slash through an equal sign, ≠, it means not equal.
We summarize the symbols of equality and inequality in Table 2.2.
Algebraic Notation Say
a=b a is equal to b
a≠b a is not equal to b
a<b a is less than b
a>b a is greater than b
a≤b a is less than or equal to b
a≥b a is greater than or equal to b

Symbols < and >
The symbols < and > each have a smaller side and a larger side.

Grouping symbols in algebra are much like the commas, colons, and other punctuation marks in written language. They
indicate which expressions are to be kept together and separate from other expressions. Table 2.3 lists three of the most
commonly used grouping symbols in algebra.
Common Grouping Symbols
parentheses ( )
brackets [ ]
braces { }

Here are some examples of expressions that include grouping symbols. We will simplify expressions like these later in this

Suppose we have the expression 2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2. We could write this more compactly using exponential
notation. Exponential notation is used in algebra to represent a quantity multiplied by itself several times. We write
2·2·2 as 2 3 and 2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2 as 2 9 . Inexpressionssuchas 2 3 , the 2 iscalledthebaseandthe 3 is

We say 2 3 is in exponential notation and 2·2·2 is in expanded notation.
Exponential Notation
For any expression an , a is a factor multiplied by itself n times if n is a positive integer.
an means multiplynfactors ofa
The expression an is read a to the nth power.
For powers of n=2 and n=3, we have special names.

Simplify Expressions Using the Order of Operations
We’veintroducedmostofthesymbolsandnotationusedinalgebra,butnowweneedtoclarifytheorderofoperations.
Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in different values.
For example, consider the expression:
4+3·7
Some students say it simplifies o 49. Some students say it simplifies o 25.
4+3·7 4+3·7
Since4+3gives 7. 7·7 Since3·7is 21. 4+21
And7·7is 49. 49 And21+4makes 25. 25
Imagine the confusion that could result if every problem had several different correct answers. The same expression
should give the same result. So mathematicians established some guidelines called the order of operations, which
outlines the order in which parts of an expression must be simplified.
Order of Operations
When simplifying mathematical expressions perform the operations in the following order:
1.Parentheses and other Grouping Symbols
• Simplify all expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols, working on the innermost
parentheses first.
2.Exponents
• Simplify all expressions with exponents.
3.Multiplication andDivision
• Perform all multiplication and division in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority.
4.Addition andSubtraction
• Perform all addition and subtraction in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority.

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra 125
The constant that multiplies the variable(s) in a term is called the coefficient. We can think of the coefficient as the
number in front of the variable. The coefficient of the term 3x is 3. When we write x, the coefficient is 1, since
x = 1 ⋅ x. Table 2.5 gives the coefficients for each of the terms in the left column.
Term Coefficient

9a 9
y 1
5x2 5

An algebraic expression may consist of one or more terms added or subtracted. In this chapter, we will only work with
terms that are added together. Table 2.6 gives some examples of algebraic expressions with various numbers of terms.
Notice that we include the operation before a term with it.

EXAMPLE 2.19
Identify each term in the expression 9b+15x2+a+6. Then identify the coefficient of each term.
Solution
The expression has four terms. They are 9b, 15x2, a, and 6.
The coefficient of 9b is 9.
The coefficient of 15x2 is 15.
Remember that if no number is written before a variable, the coefficient is 1. So the coefficient of a is 1.
The coefficient of a constant is the constant, so the coefficient of 6 is 6.
TRY IT : :2.37 Identify all terms in the given expression, and their coefficients:

Some terms share common traits. Look at the following terms. Which ones seem to have traits in common?

126 Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra
5x, 7, n2, 4, 3x, 9n2
Which of these terms are like terms?
• The terms 7 and 4 are both constant terms.
• The terms 5x and 3x are both terms with x.
• The terms n2 and 9n2 both have n2.
Terms are called like terms if they have the same variables and exponents. All constant terms are also like terms. So
among the terms 5x, 7, n2, 4, 3x, 9n2,
7and4are like terms.
5xand3xare like terms.
n2 and9n2 are like terms.
Like Terms
Terms that are either constants or have the same variables with the same exponents are like terms.
EXAMPLE 2.20
Identify the like terms:
ⓐ y3 , 7x2, 14, 23, 4y3 , 9x, 5x2 ⓑ 4x2+2x+5x2+6x+40x+8xy
Solution
ⓐ y3 , 7x2, 14, 23, 4y3 , 9x, 5x2
Look at the variables and exponents. The expression contains y3 , x2, x, and constants.
The terms y3 and 4y3 are like terms because they both have y3 .
The terms 7x2 and 5x2 are like terms because they both have x2.
The terms 14 and 23 are like terms because they are both constants.
The term 9x does not have any like terms in this list since no other terms have the variable x raised to the power of 1.
ⓑ 4x2+2x+5x2+6x+40x+8xy
Look at the variables and exponents. The expression contains the terms 4x2, 2x, 5x2, 6x, 40x, and8xy
The terms 4x2 and 5x2 are like terms because they both have x2.
The terms 2x, 6x, and40x are like terms because they all have x.
The term 8xy has no like terms in the given expression because no other terms contain the two variables xy.
TRY IT : :2.39 Identify the like terms in the list or the expression:

Translate Words to Algebraic Expressions
In the previous section, we listed many operation symbols that are used in algebra, and then we translated expressions
and equations into word phrases and sentences. Now we’ll reverse the process and translate word phrases into algebraic
expressions. The symbols and variables we’ve talked about will help us do that. They are summarized in Table 2.7.
Operation Phrase Expression
Addition a plus b a+b
the sum of a and b
a increased by b
b more than a
the total of a and b
b added to a
Subtraction a minus b a−b
the difference of a and b
b subtracted from a
a decreased by b
b less than a
Multiplication a times b a⋅b, ab, a(b), (a)(b)
the product of a and b
Division a divided by b a÷b, a/b, a , ba
b
the quotient of a and b
the ratio of a and b

HOW TO : :DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.
Step 1. Substitute the number for the variable in the equation.
Step 2. Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.
Step 3. Determine whether the resulting equation is true.
◦ If it is true, the number is a solution.
◦ If it is not true, the number is not a solution.

Wewilluseamodeltohelpyouunderstandhowtheprocessofsolvinganequationislikesolvingapuzzle.Anenvelope
represents the variable – since its contents are unknown – and each counter represents one.
Suppose a desk has an imaginary line dividing it in half. We place three counters and an envelope on the left side of

Let’s write algebraically the steps we took to discover how many counters were in the envelope.
First, we took away three from each side.
Then we were left with five.
Now let’s check our solution. We substitute 5 for x in the original equation and see if we get a true statement.

138 Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra
Our solution is correct. Five counters in the envelope plus three more equals eight.
MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity, “Subtraction Property of Equality” will help you develop a better
understanding of how to solve equations by using the Subtraction Property of Equality.
EXAMPLE 2.30
Write an equation modeled by the envelopes and counters, and then solve the equation:
Solution
On the left, write x for the contents of the envelope, add the 4 counters, so we have x+4. x+4
On the right, there are 5 counters. 5
The two sides are equal. x+4=5
Solve the equation by subtracting 4 counters from each side.
We can see that there is one counter in the envelope. This can be shown algebraically as:
Substitute 1 for x in the equation to check.
Since x=1 makes the statement true, we know that 1 is indeed a solution.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Identify multiples of numbers
Use common divisibility tests
Find all the factors of a number
Identify prime and composite numbers
Be Prepared!
Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.
1. Which of the following numbers are counting numbers (natural numbers)?
0, 4, 215
If you missed this problem, reviewExample 1.1.
2. Find the sum of 3, 5, and 7.
If you missed the problem, reviewExample 2.1.
Identify Multiples of Numbers
Annie is counting the shoes in her closet. The shoes are matched in pairs, so she doesn’t have to count each one. She
counts by twos: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. She has 12 shoes in her closet.
The numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are called multiples of 2. Multiples of 2 can be written as the product of a counting
number and 2. The first six multiples of 2 are given below.
1 ⋅ 2 = 2
2 ⋅ 2 = 4
3 ⋅ 2 = 6
4 ⋅ 2 = 8
5 ⋅ 2 = 10
6 ⋅ 2 = 12
A multiple of a number is the product of the number and a counting number. So a multiple of 3 would be the product
of a counting number and 3. Below are the first six multiples of 3.
1 ⋅ 3 = 3
2 ⋅ 3 = 6
3 ⋅ 3 = 9
4 ⋅ 3 = 12
5 ⋅ 3 = 15
6 ⋅ 3 = 18
We can find the multiples of any number by continuing this process. Table 2.8 shows the multiples of 2 through 9 for
the first twelve counting numbers.

Unlike the other patterns we’ve examined so far, this pattern does not involve the last digit. The pattern for multiples of
3 is based on the sum of the digits. If the sum of the digits of a number is a multiple of 3, then the number itself is a

MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity “Model Multiplication and Factoring” will help you develop a better
understanding of multiplication and factoring.
For example, suppose a choreographer is planning a dance for a ballet recital. There are 24 dancers, and for a certain
scene, the choreographer wants to arrange the dancers in groups of equal sizes on stage.
In how many ways can the dancers be put into groups of equal size? Answering this question is the same as identifying
the factors of 24. Table 2.11 summarizes the different ways that the choreographer can arrange the dancers.

Table 2.11
What patterns do you see in Table 2.11? Did you notice that the number of groups times the number of dancers per group
is always 24? This makes sense, since there are always 24 dancers.
You may notice another pattern if you look carefully at the first two columns. These two columns contain the exact same
set of numbers—but in reverse order. They are mirrors of one another, and in fact, both columns list all of the factors of
24, which are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
We can find all the factors of any counting number by systematically dividing the number by each counting number,
starting with 1. If the quotient is also a counting number, then the divisor and the quotient are factors of the number.
We can stop when the quotient becomes smaller than the divisor.
HOW TO : :FIND ALL THE FACTORS OF A COUNTING NUMBER.
Step 1. Divide the number by each of the counting numbers, in order, until the quotient is smaller
than the divisor.
◦ If the quotient is a counting number, the divisor and quotient are a pair of factors.
◦ If the quotient is not a counting number, the divisor is not a factor.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11756/1.9

Chapter 2 The Language of Algebra 165
Solution
We can start our tree using any factor pair of 48. Let's use 2 and 24.
We circle the 2 because it is prime and so that branch is complete.
Now we will factor 24. Let's use 4 and 6.
Neither factor is prime, so we do not circle either.
We factor the 4, using 2 and 2.
We factor 6, using 2 and 3.
We circle the 2s and the 3 since they are prime. Now all of the
branches end in a prime.
Write the product of the circled numbers. 2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅3
Write in exponential form. 24⋅3
Check this on your own by multiplying all the factors together. The result should be 48.

Tobeginbuildingthe“ladder,”dividethegivennumberbyitssmallestprimefactor.Forexample,tostarttheladderfor
36, we divide 36 by 2, the smallest prime factor of 36.
To add a “step” to the ladder, we continue dividing by the same prime until it no longer divides evenly.
Then we divide by the next prime; so we divide 9 by 3.
We continue dividing up the ladder in this way until the quotient is prime. Since the quotient, 3, is prime, we stop here.
Do you see why the ladder method is sometimes called stacked division?
The prime factorization is the product of all the primes on the sides and top of the ladder.

Prime Factors Method
Anotherwaytofindtheleastcommonmultipleoftwonumbersistousetheirprimefactors.We’llusethismethodtofind
the LCM of 12 and 18.
We start by finding the prime factorization of each number.
12=2⋅2⋅3 18=2⋅3⋅3
Then we write each number as a product of primes, matching primes vertically when possible.
12=2⋅2⋅3
18=2⋅ 3⋅3
Now we bring down the primes in each column. The LCM is the product of these factors.
Noticethattheprimefactorsof 12 andtheprimefactorsof 18 areincludedintheLCM.Bymatchingupthecommon
primes, each common prime factor is used only once. This ensures that 36 is the least common multiple.
HOW TO : :FIND THE LCM USING THE PRIME FACTORS METHOD.
Step 1. Find the prime factorization of each number.
Step 2. Write each number as a product of primes, matching primes vertically when possible.
Step 3. Bring down the primes in each column.

Order Positive and Negative Numbers
We can use the number line to compare and order positive and negative numbers. Going from left to right, numbers
increase in value. Going from right to left, numbers decrease in value. SeeFigure 3.10.
Figure 3.10
Just as we did with positive numbers, we can use inequality symbols to show the ordering of positive and negative
numbers.Rememberthatweusethenotation a<b (read a islessthan b)when a istotheleftof b onthenumber
line.Wewrite a>b (read a isgreaterthan b)when a istotherightof b onthenumberline.Thisisshownforthe
numbers 3 and 5 inFigure 3.11.
Figure 3.11 The number 3 is to the left of
5 on the number line. So 3 is less than
5, and 5 is greater than 3.
The numbers lines to follow show a few more examples.
ⓐ
4 is to the right of 1 on the number line, so 4>1.
1 is to the left of 4 on the number line, so 1<4.
ⓑ
−2 is to the left of 1 on the number line, so −2<1.
1 is to the right of −2 on the number line, so 1>−2.
ⓒ
−1 is to the right of −3 on the number line, so −1>−3.
−3 is to the left of −1 on the number line, so −3< −1.

The specific meaning becomes clear by looking at how it is used. You have seen the symbol “−”, in three different ways.
Between two numbers, the symbol indicates the operation of subtraction.
10−4
We read 10−4 as 10minus 4.
In front of a number, the symbol indicates a negative number.
−8
We read −8 asnegative eight.
In front of a variable or a number, it indicates the opposite.
−x
We read−x asthe opposite of x.
Here we have two signs. The sign in the parentheses indicates that the number is negative 2.
−(−2) The sign outside the parentheses indicates the opposite. We read −(−2) asthe opposite of
−2.
Opposite Notation
−a means the opposite of the number a
The notation −a is readthe opposite of a.

Simplify Expressions with Integers
Nowthatyouhavemodeled addingsmallpositive andnegative integers, youcanvisualize themodel inyourmindto
simplifyexpressionswith any integers.
For example, if you want to add 37+(−53), you don’t have to count out 37 blue counters and 53 red counters.
Picture 37 bluecounterswith 53 redcounterslinedupunderneath.Sincetherewouldbemorenegativecountersthan
positive counters, the sum would be negative. Because 53−37=16, there are 16 more negative counters.
37+(−53)=−16
Let’stryanotherone.We’lladd −74+(−27). Imagine 74 redcountersand 27 moreredcounters,sowehave 101
red counters all together. This means the sum is −101.
−74+(−27)=−101
Look again at the results ofExample 3.14-Example 3.17.
5+3 −5+(−3)
both positive, sum positive both negative, sum negative
When the signs are the same, the counters would be all the same color, so add them.
−5+3 5+(−3)
different signs, more negatives different signs, more positives
Sum negative sum positive
When the signs are different, some counters would make neutral pairs; subtract to see how many are left.

Perhaps when you were younger, you read 5−3 as five take away three. When we use counters, we can think of
subtraction the same way.

• First, we subtracted 3 positives from 5 positives to get 2 positives.
• Then we subtracted 3 negatives from 5 negatives to get 2 negatives.
Each example used counters of only one color, and the “take away” model of subtraction was easy to apply.

Solution
Interpret the expression. −5−3 means −5 take away 3.
Model the first number. Start with 5 negatives.
Take away the second number.
So we need to take away 3 positives.
But there are no positives to take away.
Add neutral pairs until you have 3 positives.
Now take away 3 positives.

Subtraction Property
a−b=a+(−b)
Look at these two examples.
We see that 6−4 gives the same answer as 6+(−4).
Of course, when we have a subtraction problem that has only positive numbers, like the first example, we just do the
subtraction. We already knew how to subtract 6−4 long ago. But knowing that 6−4 gives the same answer as
6+(−4) helps when we are subtracting negative numbers.

Solution
ⓐ
13−8 and 13+(−8)

Subtracting 8 from 13 is the same as adding −8 to 13.
ⓑ

Model the Division Property of Equality

variable by adding or subtracting the constant term. Now we’ll see how to solve equations that involve division.
We will model anequationwith envelopes and counters inFigure 3.21.
Figure 3.21
Here, there are two identical envelopes that contain the same number of counters. Remember, the left side of the
workspace must equal the right side, but the counters on the left side are “hidden” in the envelopes. So how many
counters are in each envelope?
Todeterminethenumber,separatethecountersontherightsideinto 2 groupsofthesamesize.So 6 countersdivided
into 2 groups means there must be 3 counters in each group (since 6÷2=3).
What equation models the situation shown in Figure 3.22? There are two envelopes, and each contains x counters.
Together, the two envelopes must contain a total of 6 counters. So the equation that models the situation is 2x=6.

254 Chapter 3 Integers
Figure 3.22
We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 as we did with the envelopes and counters.
Wefoundthateachenvelopecontains 3 counters. Doesthischeck?Weknow 2·3=6, soitworks.Threecountersin

Nowwehave 3 identicalenvelopesand 12 counters. Howmanycountersareineachenvelope?Wehavetoseparate
the 12 counters into 3 groups. Since 12÷3=4, there must be 4 counters in each envelope. SeeFigure 3.24.
Figure 3.24
The equation that models the situation is 3x=12. We can divide both sides of the equation by 3.
Does this check? It does because 3·4=12.

We can use the Equivalent Fractions Property to algebraically change a fraction to an equivalent one. Remember, two
fractions are equivalent if they have the same value. The Equivalent Fractions Property is repeated below for reference.
Equivalent Fractions Property
If a, b, c are whole numbers where b≠0, c≠0, then
a a·c a·c a
= and =
b b·c b·c b
To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, we will first have to convert each fraction to an equivalent
1 1
fraction with the LCD. Let’s see how to change and to equivalent fractions with denominator 12 without using
4 6
models.

Use the Equivalent Fractions Property to convert each fraction to an
equivalent fraction with the LCD, multiplying both the numerator and
denominator of each fraction by the same number.
Simplify the numerators and denominators.
We do not reduce the resulting fractions. If we did, we would get back to our original fractions and lose the common
denominator.

Which is larger, 0.04 or 0.40?
If you think of this as money, you know that $0.40 (forty cents) is greater than $0.04 (four cents). So,
0.40>0.04
In previous chapters, we used the number line to order numbers.

Place two zeros after the decimal point in 20, as place holders so that both numbers have
two decimal places.
Subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then place the decimal in the answer
under the decimal points in the given numbers.

So let’s see what we would get as the product of decimals by converting them to fractions first. We will do two examples
side-by-side in Table 5.3. Look for a pattern.

100 1000
Convert back to decimals. 0.21 0.092
Table 5.3
There is a pattern that we can use. In A, we multiplied two numbers that each had one decimal place, and the product had
two decimal places. In B, we multiplied a number with one decimal place by a number with two decimal places, and the
product had three decimal places.
How many decimal places would you expect for the product of (0.01(0.004? If you said “five”, you recognized the
pattern. When we multiply two numbers with decimals, we count all the decimal places in the factors—in this case two
plus three—to get the number of decimal places in the product—in this case five.

Multiply by Powers of 10
Inmanyfields,especiallyinthesciences,itiscommontomultiplydecimalsbypowersof 10. Let’sseewhathappens
when we multiply 1.9436 by some powers of 10.
Look at the results without the final zeros. Do you notice a pattern?
1.9436(10) = 19.436
1.9436(100) = 194.36
1.9436(1000) = 1943.6
The number of places that the decimal point moved is the same as the number of zeros in the power of ten. Table 5.4
summarizes the results.
Multiply by Number of zeros Number of places decimal point moves
10 1 1 place to the right
100 2 2 places to the right
1,000 3 3 places to the right
10,000 4 4 places to the right
Table 5.4
We can use this pattern as a shortcut to multiply by powers of ten instead of multiplying using the vertical format. We can
count the zeros in the power of 10 and then move the decimal point that same of places to the right.
So, for example, to multiply 45.86 by 100, move the decimal point 2 places to the right.

fraction to a decimal by treating it as a division problem.
Convert a Fraction to a Decimal
To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator of the fraction.
EXAMPLE 5.28
3
Write the fraction as a decimal.
4
Solution
A fraction bar means division, so we can write the fraction 3 using
4
division.
Divide.
So the fraction 3 is equal to
4
0.75.

EXAMPLE 5.29
7
Write the fraction − as a decimal.
2
Solution
The value of this fraction is negative. After dividing, the value of the decimal will be
7
negative. We do the division ignoring the sign, and then write the negative sign in the −
2
answer.
Divide 7 by 2.
So,

43
Write as a decimal.
22
Solution
Divide 43 by 22.
Notice that the differences of 120 and 100 repeat, so there is a repeat in the digits of the quotient; 54 will repeat
endlessly. The first decimal place in the quotient, 9, is not part of the pattern. So,

dis the length of the diameter.
The circumference is2πr. C=2πr
The area isπr2. A= πr2
Since the diameter is twice the radius, another way to find the circumference is to use the formula C= πd.
Suppose we want to find the exact area of a circle of radius 10 inches. To calculate the area, we would evaluate the
formula for the area when r =10 inches and leave the answer in terms of π.
A= πr2
A= π(102)
A= π ·100
We write π after the 100. So the exact value of the area is A=100π square inches.
To approximate the area, we would substitute π ≈3.14.

Properties of Equality
Subtraction Property of Equality Addition Property of Equality
For any numbers a, b, andc, For any numbers a, b, andc,
If a=b, then a−c=b−c. If a=b, then a+c=b+c.
The Division Property of Equality The Multiplication Property of Equality
For any numbers a, b, andc, andc≠0 For any numbers a, b, andc,
If a=b, then a c = b c If a=b, then ac=bc
When you add, subtract, multiply or divide the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.

Simplify Expressions with Square Roots
To start this section, we need to review some important vocabulary and notation.
Rememberthatwhenanumber n ismultipliedbyitself,wecanwritethisas n2, whichwereadaloudas “nsquared.”
For example, 82 is read as “8squared.”
We call 64 thesquareof 8 because 82=64. Similarly, 121 is the square of 11, because 112=121.
Square of a Number
If n2=m, then m is the square of n.
Modeling Squares
Doyouknowwhyweusethewordsquare?Ifweconstructasquarewiththreetilesoneachside,thetotalnumberoftiles

This is why we say that the square of three is nine.
32=9
The number 9 is called aperfect squarebecause it is the square of a whole number.

Perfect Squares
Aperfect squareis the square of a whole number.
What happens when you square a negative number?
(−8)2 =(−8)(−8)
=64
Whenwemultiplytwonegativenumbers,theproductisalwayspositive.So,thesquareofanegativenumberisalways
positive.
The chart shows the squares of the negative integers from −1 to −15.
Did you notice that these squares are the same as the squares of the positive numbers?
Square Roots
Sometimeswewillneedtolookattherelationshipbetweennumbersandtheirsquaresinreverse.Because 102=100,
we say 100 is the square of 10. We can also say that 10 is a square root of 100.
Square Root of a Number
A number whose square is m is called asquare rootof m.
If n2=m, then n is asquare rootof m.
Notice (−10)2=100 also,so −10 isalsoasquarerootof 100. Therefore,both 10 and −10 aresquarerootsof 100.
So, every positive number has two square roots: one positive and one negative.

root. The positive square root is also called theprincipal square root.
Square Root Notation
m is read as “the square root of m.”
Ifm=n2, then m=nforn≥0.
We can also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because 02=0, 0=0. Notice that zero has only one
square root.
The chart shows the square roots of the first 15 perfect square numbers.

Every positive number has two square roots and the radical sign indicates the positive one. We write 100=10. If
we want to find the negative square root of a number, we place a negative in front of the radical sign. For example,
− 100=−10.

Table 6.1
Do you see the pattern?
To convert a percent number to a decimal number, we move the decimal point two places to the left and remove the %
sign. (Sometimes the decimal point does not appear in the percent number, but just like we can think of the integer 6
as 6.0, we can think of 6% as 6.0%. ) Notice that we may need to add zeros in front of the number when moving the
decimal to the left.

point two places to the left.

To determine if the equation is a proportion, we find the cross products. If they are equal, the equation is a proportion.
ⓐ
28⋅4=112 9⋅12=108
Find the cross products.
Since the cross products are not equal, 28·4≠9·12, the equation is not a proportion.

Write Percent Equations As Proportions

For example, 60%= and we can simplify = . Since the equation = shows a percent equal to an

equivalent ratio, we call it apercent proportion. Using the vocabulary we used earlier:

Percent Proportion
The amount is to the base as the percent is to 100.

If we restate the problem in the words of a proportion, it may be easier to set up the proportion:
The amount is to the base as the percent is to one hundred.

Let's summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is rational or irrational.
If the decimal form of a number
• stops or repeats, the number is rational.
• does not stop and does not repeat, the number is irrational.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Use the commutative and associative properties
Evaluate expressions using the commutative and associative properties
Simplify expressions using the commutative and associative properties
Be Prepared!
Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.
1. Simplify: 7y+2+y+13.

If you missed this problem, reviewExample 3.3.
In the next few sections, we will take a look at the properties of real numbers. Many of these properties will describe
thingsyoualreadyknow,butitwillhelptogivenamestothepropertiesanddefinethemformally.Thiswaywe’llbeable
to refer to them and use them as we solve equations in the next chapter.
Use the Commutative and Associative Properties
Think about adding two numbers, such as 5 and 3.
5+3 3+5
8 8
The results are the same. 5+3=3+5
Notice, the order in which we add does not matter. The same is true when multiplying 5 and 3.
5·3 3·5
15 15
Again, the results are the same! 5·3=3·5. The order in which we multiply does not matter.
These examples illustrate the commutative properties of addition and multiplication.
Commutative Properties
Commutative Property of Addition: if a and b are real numbers, then
a+b=b+a
Commutative Property of Multiplication: if a and b are real numbers, then
a·b=b·a
Thecommutativepropertieshavetodowithorder.Ifyouchangetheorderofthenumberswhenaddingormultiplying,
the result is the same.
EXAMPLE 7.5
Use the commutative properties to rewrite the following expressions:
ⓐ −1+3=_____
ⓑ 4·9=_____
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11756/1.9

Chapter 7 The Properties of Real Numbers 605
Solution
ⓐ
−1+3=_____
Use the commutative property of addition to change the order. −1+3=3+(−1)
ⓑ
4·9=_____
Use the commutative property of multiplication to change the order. 4·9=9·4
TRY IT : :7.9 Use the commutative properties to rewrite the following:
ⓐ −4+7=_____ ⓑ 6·12=_____
TRY IT : :7.10 Use the commutative properties to rewrite the following:
ⓐ 14+(−2)=_____ ⓑ 3(−5)=_____
What about subtraction? Does order matter when we subtract numbers? Does 7−3 give the same result as 3−7?
7−3 3−7
4 −4
4≠−4
The results are not the same.7−3≠3−7
Since changing the order of the subtraction did not give the same result, we can say that subtraction is not commutative.
Let’s see what happens when we divide two numbers. Is division commutative?
12÷4 4÷12
12 4
4 12
1
3
3
1
3≠
3
The results are not the same. So12÷4≠4÷12
Since changing the order of the division did not give the same result, division is not commutative.
Addition and multiplication are commutative. Subtraction and division are not commutative.
Suppose you were asked to simplify this expression.
7+8+2
How would you do it and what would your answer be?
Some people would think 7+8is15 and then 15+2is17. Others might start with 8+2makes10 and then
7+10makes17.

The same principle holds true for multiplication as well. Suppose we want to find the value of the following expression:

Changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result, as shown inFigure 7.4.
Figure 7.4
Whenmultiplyingthreenumbers,changingthegroupingofthenumbersdoesnotchangetheresult.Thisisknownasthe
Associative Property of Multiplication.
If we multiply three numbers, changing the grouping does not affect the product.
You probably know this, but the terminology may be new to you. These examples illustrate theAssociative Properties.
Associative Properties
Associative Property of Addition: if a, b, and c are real numbers, then
(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)
Associative Property of Multiplication: if a, b, and c are real numbers, then
(a·b)·c=a·(b·c)

·15=__________

Solution
ⓐ
(3+0.6)+0.4=__________
Change the grouping. (3+0.6)+0.4=3+(0.6+0.4)
Notice that 0.6+0.4 is 1, so the addition will be easier if we group as shown on the right.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
Simplify expressions using the distributive property
Evaluate expressions using the distributive property
Be Prepared!
Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.
1. Multiply: 3(0.25).
If you missed this problem, reviewExample 5.15
2. Simplify: 10−(−2)(3).
If you missed this problem, reviewExample 3.51
3. Combine like terms: 9y+17+3y−2.

Simplify Expressions Using the Distributive Property
Suppose three friends are going to the movies. They each need $9.25; that is, 9 dollars and 1 quarter. How much
money do they need all together? You can think about the dollars separately from the quarters.
They need 3 times $9, so $27, and 3 times 1 quarter, so 75 cents. In total, they need $27.75.
If you think about doing the math in this way, you are using the Distributive Property.
Distributive Property
If a, b, c are real numbers, then
a(b+c)=ab+ac

In this section we will see how to convert among different types of units, such as feet to miles or kilograms to pounds. The
basic idea in all of the unit conversions will be to use a form of 1, the multiplicative identity, to change the units but not
the value of a quantity.
Make Unit Conversions in the U.S. System
There are two systems of measurement commonly used around the world. Most countries use the metric system. The
United States uses a different system of measurement, usually called the U.S. system. We will look at the U.S. system first.
The U.S. system of measurement uses units of inch, foot, yard, and mile to measure length and pound and ton to measure
weight. For capacity, the units used are cup, pint, quart and gallons. Both the U.S. system and the metric system measure
time in seconds, minutes, or hours.
The equivalencies among the basic units of the U.S. system of measurement are listed in Table 7.2. The table also shows,
in parentheses, the common abbreviations for each measurement.

3 teaspoons (t) = 1 tablespoon (T)
16 Tablespoons (T) = 1 cup (C)
1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in)
1 cup (C) = 8 fluid ounces (fl oz)
1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft)
1 pint (pt) = 2 cups (C)
1 mile (mi) = 5280 feet (ft)
1 quart (qt) = 2 pints (pt)
1 gallon (gal) = 4 quarts (qt)
Weight Time
1 minute (min) = 60 seconds (s)
1 hour (h) = 60 minutes (min)
1 pound (lb) = 16 ounces (oz)
1 day = 24 hours (h)
1 ton = 2000 pounds (lb)
1 week (wk) = 7 days
1 year (yr) = 365 days
Table 7.2
In many real-life applications, we need to convert between units of measurement. We will use the identity property of
multiplication to do these conversions. We’ll restate the Identity Property of Multiplication here for easy reference.
For any real numbera, a·1=a 1·a=a
To use the identity property of multiplication, we write 1 in a form that will help us convert the units. For example,
supposewewanttoconvertinchestofeet.Weknowthat 1 footisequalto 12 inches,sowecanwrite 1 asthefraction

On the other hand, if we wanted to convert 5 feet to inches, we would choose the fraction that has feet in the
denominator.

We treat the unit words like factors and ‘divide out’ common units like we do common factors.

Make Unit Conversions in the Metric System
Inthemetricsystem,unitsarerelatedbypowersof 10. Therootwordsoftheirnamesreflectthisrelation.Forexample,
the basic unit for measuring length is a meter. One kilometer is 1000 meters; the prefix kilo- means thousand. One
1 1
centimeter is of a meter, because the prefix centi- means one one-hundredth (just like one cent is of one
100 100
dollar).
The equivalencies of measurements in the metric system are shown in Table 7.3. The common abbreviations for each
measurement are given in parentheses.
Metric Measurements
Length Mass Volume/Capacity
1 kilometer (km) = 1000 m 1 kilogram (kg) = 1000 g 1 kiloliter (kL) = 1000 L
1 hectometer (hm) = 100 m 1 hectogram (hg) = 100 g 1 hectoliter (hL) = 100 L
1 dekameter (dam) = 10 m 1 dekagram (dag) = 10 g 1 dekaliter (daL) = 10 L
1 meter (m) = 1 m 1 gram (g) = 1 g 1 liter (L) = 1 L
1 decimeter (dm) = 0.1 m 1 decigram (dg) = 0.1 g 1 deciliter (dL) = 0.1 L
1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 m 1 centigram (cg) = 0.01 g 1 centiliter (cL) = 0.01 L
1 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 m 1 milligram (mg) = 0.001 g 1 milliliter (mL) = 0.001 L
1 meter = 100 centimeters 1 gram = 100 centigrams 1 liter = 100 centiliters
1 meter = 1000 millimeters 1 gram = 1000 milligrams 1 liter = 1000 milliliters
Table 7.3
To make conversions in the metric system, we will use the same technique we did in the U.S. system. Using the identity
property of multiplication, we will multiply by a conversion factor of one to get to the correct units.
Have you ever run a 5 k or 10 k race? The lengths of those races are measured in kilometers. The metric system is
commonly used in the United States when talking about the length of a race.
EXAMPLE 7.50
Nick ran a 10-kilometer race. How many meters did he run?

Since the metric system is based on multiples of ten, conversions involve multiplying by multiples of ten. In Decimal
Operations, we learned how to simplify these calculations by just moving the decimal.
To multiply by 10, 100, or1000, we move the decimal to the right 1, 2, or3 places, respectively. To multiply by
0.1, 0.01, or0.001 we move the decimal to the left 1, 2, or3 places respectively.
We can apply this pattern when we make measurement conversions in the metric system.

Convert Between Fahrenheit and Celsius Temperatures
Haveyoueverbeeninaforeigncountryandheardtheweatherforecast?Iftheforecastisfor 22°C. Whatdoesthat
mean?
The U.S. and metric systems use different scales to measure temperature. The U.S. system uses degrees Fahrenheit,
written °F. The metric system uses degrees Celsius, written °C. Figure 7.9 shows the relationship between the two
systems.
Figure 7.9 A temperature of 37°C is
equivalent to 98.6°F.

652 Chapter 7 The Properties of Real Numbers
If we know the temperature in one system, we can use a formula to convert it to the other system.
Temperature Conversion
To convert from Fahrenheit temperature, F, to Celsius temperature, C, use the formula
C= 5 (F−32)
9
To convert from Celsius temperature, C, to Fahrenheit temperature, F, use the formula
F = 9C+32
5
EXAMPLE 7.57
Convert 50°F into degrees Celsius.
Solution
We will substitute 50°F into the formula to find C.
Use the formula for converting °F to °C C= 5 (F−32)
9
Simplify in parentheses. C= 5 (18)
9
Multiply. C=10
A temperature of 50°F is equivalent to 10°C.
TRY IT : :7.113 Convert the Fahrenheit temperatures to degrees Celsius: 59°F.
TRY IT : :7.114 Convert the Fahrenheit temperatures to degrees Celsius: 41°F.
EXAMPLE 7.58
The weather forecast for Paris predicts a high of 20°C. Convert the temperature into degrees Fahrenheit.
Solution
We will substitute 20°C into the formula to find F.
Use the formula for converting °F to °C F = 9C+32
5
Multiply. F =36+32
Add. F =68
So 20°C is equivalent to 68°F.

equation true is called a solution to the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle.
Solution of an Equation
Asolution of an equationis a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.
In the earlier sections, we listed the steps to determine if a value is a solution. We restate them here.
HOW TO : :DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.
Step 1. Substitute the number for the variable in the equation.
Step 2. Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.
Step 3. Determine whether the resulting equation is true.
◦ If it is true, the number is a solution.
◦ If it is not true, the number is not a solution.
EXAMPLE 8.1
Determine whether y= 3 is a solution for 4y+3=8y.

Chapter 8 Solving Linear Equations 667
For all real numbers a, b, and c, if a=b, then a+c=b+c.
When you add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.
WeintroducedtheSubtractionPropertyofEqualityearlierbymodelingequationswithenvelopesandcounters.Figure
8.2models the equation x+3=8.
Figure 8.2

Some people picture a balance scale, as inFigure 8.3, when they solve equations.
Figure 8.3
The quantities on both sides of the equal sign in an equation are equal, or balanced. Just as with the balance scale,
whatever you do to one side of the equation you must also do to the other to keep it balanced.

Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality
a b
Division Property of Equality: For all real numbers a, b, c, and c≠0, if a=b, then c = c.
Multiplication Property of Equality: For all real numbers a, b, c, if a=b, then ac=bc.
When you divide or multiply both sides of an equation by the same quantity, you still have equality.

Step 3. Name what you are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. You can use any letter for the
variable, but it may help to choose one that helps you remember what it represents.
• Let p= the original price of the shirt
Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may help to first restate the problem in one sentence, with all the important
information. Then translate the sentence into an equation.

Write the equation.
Multiply both sides by 2.
Simplify.
Step 6.Checkthe answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
• Wefoundthat p=36, whichmeanstheoriginalpricewas $36. Does $36 makesenseintheproblem?Yes,because
18 is one-half of 36, and the shirt was on sale at half the original price.
Step 7.Answerthe question with a complete sentence.
• Theproblemasked“Whatwastheoriginalpriceoftheshirt?”Theanswertothequestionis:“Theoriginalpriceofthe
shirt was $36.”

The total value of all the coins is $6.64. Notice how Table 9.1 helped us organize all the information. Let's see how this
method is used to solve a coin word problem.
EXAMPLE 9.11
Adalbertohas $2.25 indimesandnickelsinhispocket.Hehasninemorenickelsthandimes.Howmanyofeachtypeof

Solution
Step 1.Readthe problem. Make sure you understand all the words and ideas.
• Determine the types of coins involved.
Thinkaboutthestrategyweusedtofindthevalueofthehandfulofcoins.Thefirstthingyouneedistonoticewhattypes
of coins are involved. Adalberto has dimes and nickels.
• Create a tableto organize the information.
◦ Label the columns ‘type’, ‘number’, ‘value’, ‘total value’.
◦ List the types of coins.
◦ Write in the value of each type of coin.
◦ Write in the total value of all the coins.

Step 2.Identifywhat you are looking for.

738 Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry
• We are asked to find the number of dimes and nickels Adalberto has.
Step 3.Namewhat you are looking for.
• Use variable expressions to represent the number of each type of coin.
• Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of coin.
Inthisproblemyoucannotcounteachtypeofcoin—thatiswhatyouarelookingfor—butyouhaveaclue.There
are nine more nickels than dimes. The number of nickels is nine more than the number of dimes.
Letd =number of dimes.
d+9=number of nickels
Fill in the “number” column to help get everything organized.
Type Number Value ($) Total Value ($)
Dimes d 0.10

algebra. In the next few sections, we will apply our problem-solving strategies to some common geometry problems.
Use the Properties of Angles
Areyoufamiliarwiththephrase‘doa 180’? Itmeanstomakeafullturnsothatyoufacetheoppositedirection.Itcomes
from the fact that the measure of an angle that makes a straight line is 180 degrees. SeeFigure 9.5.
Figure 9.5
Anangleisformedbytworaysthatshareacommonendpoint.Eachrayiscalledasideoftheangleandthecommon
endpointiscalledthevertex.Anangleisnamedbyitsvertex.InFigure9.6, ∠A istheanglewithvertexatpoint A. The
measure of ∠A is written m∠ A.
Figure 9.6 ∠ A is the angle with vertex
at pointA.
We measure angles in degrees, and use the symbol ° to represent degrees. We use the abbreviation m to for the
measureof an angle. So if ∠A is 27°, we would write m∠ A=27.
Ifthesumofthemeasuresoftwoanglesis 180°, thentheyarecalledsupplementaryangles.InFigure9.7,eachpair
of angles is supplementary because their measures add to 180°. Each angle is thesupplementof the other.

750 Chapter 9 Math Models and Geometry
Figure 9.7 The sum of the measures of supplementary angles is 180°.
Ifthesumofthemeasuresoftwoanglesis 90°, thentheanglesarecomplementaryangles.InFigure9.8,eachpair
of angles is complementary, because their measures add to 90°. Each angle is thecomplementof the other.
Figure 9.8 The sum of the measures of
complementary angles is 90°.
Supplementary and Complementary Angles
If the sum of the measures of two angles is 180°, then the angles are supplementary.
If ∠A and ∠B are supplementary, then m∠A+m∠B=180°.
If the sum of the measures of two angles is 90°, then the angles are complementary.
If ∠A and ∠B are complementary, then m∠A+m∠B=90°.

monomial. A monomial, or a sum and/or difference of monomials, is called a polynomial.
Polynomials
polynomial—A monomial, or two or more monomials, combined by addition or subtraction
monomial—A polynomial with exactly one term
binomial— A polynomial with exactly two terms
trinomial—A polynomial with exactly three terms
Notice the roots:
• poly- means many
• mono- means one
• bi- means two
• tri- means three
Here are some examples of polynomials:
Polynomial b+1 4y2−7y+2 5x5 −4x4+x3 +8x2−9x+1
Monomial 5 4b2 −9x3
Binomial 3a−7 y2−9 17x3 +14x2
Trinomial x2−5x+6 4y2−7y+2 5a4−3a3 +a
Notice that every monomial, binomial, and trinomial is also a polynomial. They are special members of the family of
polynomialsandsotheyhavespecialnames.Weusethewords‘monomial’,‘binomial’,and‘trinomial’whenreferringto
these special polynomials and just call all the rest ‘polynomials’.

Determine the Degree of Polynomials
Inthissection,wewillworkwithpolynomialsthathaveonlyonevariableineachterm.Thedegreeofapolynomialand
the degree of its terms are determined by the exponents of the variable.
A monomial that has no variable, just a constant, is a special case. The degree of a constant is 0—it has no variable.
Degree of a Polynomial
Thedegree of a termis the exponent of its variable.
Thedegree of a constantis 0.
Thedegree of a polynomialis the highest degree of all its terms.
Let'sseehowthisworksbylookingatseveralpolynomials.We'lltakeitstepbystep,startingwithmonomials,andthen
progressing to polynomials with more terms.
Remember: Any base written without an exponent has an implied exponent of 1.

different, too. We’ll derive the properties of exponents by looking for patterns in several examples. All the exponent
properties hold true for any real numbers, but right now we will only use whole number exponents.
First, we will look at an example that leads to the Product Property.
What does this mean?
How many factors altogether?
So, we have
Notice that 5 is the sum of the exponents, 2 and 3.
x2⋅ x3
We write: x2+3
x5
The base stayed the same and we added the exponents. This leads to the Product Property for Exponents.
Product Property of Exponents
If a is a real number and m, n are counting numbers, then
am ·an =a m+n
To multiply with like bases, add the exponents.
An example with numbers helps to verify this property.
22·2 3 = ? 2 2+3

So, we have
Notice that 6 is the product of the exponents, 2 and 3.

n =am·n
To raise a power to a power, multiply the exponents.

Simplify Expressions Using the Product to a Power Property
We will now look at an expression containing a product that is raised to a power. Look for a pattern.
(2x) 3
What does this mean? 2x·2x·2x
We group the like factors together. 2·2·2·x·x·x
How many factors of 2 and of x? 2 3 ·x3
Notice that each factor was raised to the power. (2x) 3 is2 3 ·x3
(2x) 3
We write:

3 ·x3
The exponent applies to each of the factors. This leads to the Product to a Power Property for Exponents.
Product to a Power Property of Exponents
If a and b are real numbers and m is a whole number, then
(ab) m =ambm
To raise a product to a power, raise each factor to that power.
An example with numbers helps to verify this property:

attention to how we got the four terms.
(x+2)(x−y)
x2−xy+2x−2y
Where did the first term, x2, come from?
It is the product of xandx, thefirstterms in (x+2)and(x−y).
The next term, −xy, is the product of xand −y, the twoouterterms.
The third term, +2x, is the product of 2andx, the twoinnerterms.
And the last term, −2y, came from multiplying the twolastterms.
Weabbreviate“First,Outer,Inner,Last”asFOIL.Thelettersstandfor‘First,Outer,Inner,Last’.ThewordFOILiseasyto
remember and ensures we find all four products. We might say we use the FOIL method to multiply two binomials.

In Fractions you learned that fractions may be simplified by dividing out common factors from the numerator and
denominatorusingtheEquivalentFractionsProperty.Thispropertywillalsohelpusworkwithalgebraicfractions—which
are also quotients.

Quotient Property of Exponents
If a is a real number, a≠0, and m, n are whole numbers, then
a a m n =am−n , m>n and a a m n = an 1 −m, n>m

Use the Definition of a Negative Exponent
The Quotient Property of Exponents, introduced in Divide Monomials, had two forms depending on whether the
exponent in the numerator or denominator was larger.
Quotient Property of Exponents
If a is a real number, a≠0, and m, n are whole numbers, then
a a m n =am−n , m>n and a a m n = an 1 −m, n>m
x2
What if we just subtract exponents, regardless of which is larger? Let’s consider .
x5
We subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator.
x2
x5
x2−5
x−3
x2 x2
We can also simplify by dividing out common factors: .
x5 x5
This implies that x−3 = 1 and it leads us to the definition of anegative exponent.

In both cases, the decimal was moved 3 places to get the first factor, 4, by itself.
• The power of 10 is positive when the number is larger than 1:4000=4×10 3 .
• The power of 10 is negative when the number is between 0 and 1:0.004=4×10 −3 .

If a, b, c are real numbers, then
a(b+c)=ab+ac and ab+ac=a(b+c)
The form on the left is used to multiply. The form on the right is used to factor.
So how do we use the Distributive Property to factor a polynomial? We find the GCF of all the terms and write the

Figure 11.3 The rectangular coordinate system.
The x-axis and the y-axis form the rectangular coordinate system. These axes divide a plane into four areas, called
quadrants. The quadrants are identified by Roman numerals, beginning on the upper right and proceeding
counterclockwise. SeeFigure 11.4.

Ordered Pair
An ordered pair, (x, y) gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system.
The fir t number is thex-coordinate.
The second number is they-coordinate.
So how do the coordinates of a point help you locate a point on the x-y plane?
Let’s try locating the point (2, 5). In this ordered pair, the x-coordinate is 2 and the y-coordinate is 5.

Verify Solutions to an Equation in Two Variables
All the equations we solved so far have been equations with one variable. In almost every case, when we solved the
equationwegotexactlyonesolution.Theprocessofsolvinganequationendedwithastatementsuchas x=4. Then
we checked the solution by substituting back into the equation.
Here’s an example of alinear equation in one variable, and its one solution.
3x+5=17
3x=12
x=4
But equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two variables can be written in the general form
Ax+By=C. An equation of this form is called a linear equation in two variables.

By rewriting y=−5x+1 as 5x+y=1, we can see that it is a linear equation in two variables because it can be

Graph of a Linear Equation
The graph of a linear equation Ax+By=C is a straight line.
• Every point on the line is a solution of the equation.
• Every solution of this equation is a point on this line.

Intercepts of a Line
Each of the points at which a line crosses the x-axis and the y-axis is called an intercept of the line.

For each row, the y- coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x- axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the
x- axis has the form (a, 0) ; and is called the x-intercept of the line. The x- intercept occurs when y is zero.
Now, let's look at the points where these lines cross the y-axis.

What is it about the form of equation that can help us choose the most convenient method to graph its line?
Noticethatinequations#1and#2,yisisolatedononesideoftheequation,anditscoefficientis1.Wefoundpointsby
substituting values forxon the right side of the equation and then simplifying to get the correspondingy-values.
Equations#3and#4eachhavejustonevariable.Remember,inthiskindofequationthevalueofthatonevariableis

Ax+By=C.Wesubstituted y=0 and x=0 tofindthex-andy-intercepts,andthenfoundathirdpointbychoosing
a value forxory.
This leads to the following strategy for choosing the most convenient method to graph a line.
HOW TO : :CHOOSE THE MOST CONVENIENT METHOD TO GRAPH A LINE.
Step 1. If the equation has only one variable. It is a vertical or horizontal line.
◦ x=a is a vertical line passing through the x-axis at a
◦ y=b is a horizontal line passing through the y-axis at b.
Step 2. If y is isolated on one side of the equation. Graph by plotting points.
◦ Choose any three values for x and then solve for the corresponding y- values.
Step 3. If the equation is of the form Ax+By=C, find the intercepts.
◦ Find the x- and y- intercepts and then a third point.
EXAMPLE 11.29
Identify the most convenient method to graph each line:
ⓐ y=−3 ⓑ 4x−6y=12 ⓒ x=2 ⓓ y= 2x−1
5
Solution
ⓐ y=−3
This equation has only one variable, y. Its graph is a horizontal line crossing the y-axis at −3.
ⓑ 4x−6y=12
This equation is of the form Ax+By=C. Find the intercepts and one more point.
ⓒ x=2
There is only one variable, x. The graph is a vertical line crossing the x-axis at 2.
ⓓ y= 2x−1

Since y is isolated on the left side of the equation, it will be easiest to graph this line by plotting three points.

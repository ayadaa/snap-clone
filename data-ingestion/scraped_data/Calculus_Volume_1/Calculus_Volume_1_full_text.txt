About Calculus Volume 1
Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to
enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand
howthoseconceptsapplytotheirlivesandtheworldaroundthem.Duetothecomprehensive natureofthematerial, we
are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 1 covers functions, limits, derivatives, and
integration.

Introduction
In the past few years, major earthquakes have occurred in several countries around the world. In January 2010, an
earthquakeofmagnitude7.3hitHaiti.Amagnitude9earthquakeshooknortheasternJapaninMarch2011.InApril2014,
an 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile. What do these numbers mean? In particular, how
does a magnitude 9 earthquake compare with an earthquake of magnitude 8.2? Or 7.3? Later in this chapter, we show
how logarithmic functions are used to compare the relative intensity of two earthquakes based on the magnitude of each
earthquake (seeExample 1.39).
Calculus is the mathematics that describes changes in functions. In this chapter, we review all the functions necessary
to study calculus. We define polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. We review how
to evaluate these functions, and we show the properties of their graphs. We provide examples of equations with terms

1.1 | Review of Functions
Learning Objectives
1.1.1 Use functional notation to evaluate a function.
1.1.2 Determine the domain and range of a function.
1.1.3 Draw the graph of a function.
1.1.4 Find the zeros of a function.
1.1.5 Recognize a function from a table of values.
1.1.6 Make new functions from two or more given functions.
1.1.7 Describe the symmetry properties of a function.
In this section, we provide a formal definition of a function and examine several ways in which functions are
represented—namely, through tables, formulas, and graphs. We study formal notation and terms related to functions. We
alsodefinecompositionoffunctionsandsymmetryproperties.Mostofthismaterialwillbeareviewforyou,butitserves
as a handy reference to remind you of some of the algebraic techniques useful for working with functions.
Functions
Giventwosets A and B, asetwithelementsthatareorderedpairs (x, y), where x isanelementof A and y isan
element of B, is a relation from A to B. A relation from A to B defines a relationship between those two sets. A

Definition
Afunction f consistsofasetofinputs,asetofoutputs,andaruleforassigningeachinputtoexactlyoneoutput.The
set of inputs is called thedomainof the function. The set of outputs is called therangeof the function.
Forexample,considerthefunction f, wherethedomainisthesetofallrealnumbersandtheruleistosquaretheinput.
Then,theinput x=3 isassignedtotheoutput 3 2 =9. Sinceeverynonnegativerealnumberhasareal-valuesquareroot,

Forageneralfunction f withdomain D, weoftenuse x todenotetheinputand y todenotetheoutputassociatedwith
x. Whendoingso,wereferto x astheindependentvariableand y asthedependentvariable,becauseitdependson x.
Usingfunctionnotation,wewrite y= f(x), andwereadthisequationas “y equals f of x.” Forthesquaringfunction
described earlier, we write f(x)= x 2 .
The concept of a function can be visualized usingFigure 1.2,Figure 1.3, andFigure 1.4.

Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs 9
Figure 1.2 A function can be visualized as an input/output
device.
Figure 1.3 A function maps every element in the domain to
exactly one element in the range. Although each input can be
sent to only one output, two different inputs can be sent to the
same output.
Figure 1.4 In this case, a graph of a function f has a domain
of {1, 2, 3} and a range of {1, 2}. The independent variable

Figure 1.5 Here we see a graph of the function f with
domain {1, 2, 3} and rule f(x)=3−x. The graph consists
of the points (x, f(x)) for all x in the domain.
Every function has a domain. However, sometimes a function is described by an equation, as in f(x)= x 2 , with no

Finding Domain and Range
For each of the following functions, determine the i. domain and ii. range.

b. f(x)= 3x+2−1
c. f(x)= 3
x−2
Solution
a. Consider f(x)=(x−4)2 +5.
i. Since f(x)=(x−4) 2 +5 is a real number for any real number x, the domain of f is the
interval (−∞, ∞).
ii. Since (x−4) 2 ≥0, weknow f(x)=(x−4) 2 +5≥5. Therefore,therangemustbeasubset

⎩ ⎭
given y in that set, there is a real number x such that f(x)=(x−4) 2 +5=y. Solving this
equation for x, we see that we need x such that
2
(x−4) =y−5.
This equation is satisfied as long as there exists a real number x such that
x−4= ± y−5.
Since y≥5, thesquarerootiswell-defined.Weconcludethatfor x=4± y−5, f(x)=y,
and therefore the range is ⎧ ⎨y|y≥5⎫ ⎬.
⎩ ⎭
b. Consider f(x)= 3x+2−1.
i. To find the domain of f, we need the expression 3x+2≥0. Solving this inequality, we
conclude that the domain is {x|x≥−2/3}.
ii. Tofindtherangeof f, wenotethatsince 3x+2≥0, f(x)= 3x+2−1≥−1. Therefore,

Solving this equation for x, we see that x must solve the equation
3x+2=y+1.
Since y≥−1, such an x could exist. Squaring both sides of this equation, we have

3x+2=(y+1) .
Therefore, we need

Representing Functions

• A table
• A graph
• A formula

because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin.
When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of
x where f(x)=0 arecalledthezerosofafunction.Forexample,thezerosof f(x)= x 2 −4 are x= ±2. Thezeros

line x=c intersectsthegraphof f exactlyonce.Ontheotherhand,if c isnotinthedomainof f, f(c) isnotdefined
and the line x=c does not intersect the graph of f. This property is summarized in thevertical line test.
Rule: Vertical Line Test
Givenafunction f, everyverticallinethatmaybedrawnintersectsthegraphof f nomorethanonce.Ifanyvertical
line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function.
We can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a function (Figure 1.8).
Figure 1.8 (a) The set of plotted points represents the graph of
a function because every vertical line intersects the set of points,
at most, once. (b) The set of plotted points does not represent the
graph of a function because some vertical lines intersect the set

To determine whether a function is even or odd, we evaluate f(−x) and compare it tof(x) and −f(x).
a. f(−x)=−5(−x)4 +7(−x)2 −2=−5x 4 +7x 2 −2= f(x). Therefore, f is even.
b. f(−x)=2(−x) 5 −4(−x)+5=−2x 5 +4x+5. Now, f(−x)≠ f(x). Furthermore, noting that
−f(x)=−2x 5 +4x−5, we see that f(−x)≠−f(x). Therefore, f is neither even nor odd.
c. f(−x)=3(−x)/((−x)2 +1}=−3x/(x 2 +1)=−[3x/(x 2 +1)]=−f(x). Therefore, f is odd.

a. Describe the distance D (in miles) Jessica runs as a linear function of her run time t (in minutes).
b. Sketch a graph of D.
c. Interpret the meaning of the slope.
Solution
a. At time t=0, Jessica is at her house, so D(0)=0. At time t=78 minutes, Jessica has finished
running 9 mi, so D(78)=9. The slope of the linear function is
9−0 3
m= = .
78−0 26
The y-intercept is (0, 0), so the equation for this linear function is
3
D(t)= t.
26
b. To graph D, use the fact that the graph passes through the origin and has slope m=3/26.
c. The slope m=3/26≈0.115 describes the distance (in miles) Jessica runs per minute, or her average
velocity.

Behavior at Infinity
To determine the behavior of a function f as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values f(x) as the inputs,
x, become larger. For some functions, the values of f(x) approach a finite number. For example, for the function
f(x)=2+1/x, thevalues 1/x becomecloserandclosertozeroforallvaluesof x astheygetlargerandlarger.Forthis
function,wesay “f(x) approachestwoas x goestoinfinity,”andwewrite f(x)→2 as x→∞. Theline y=2 isa

concludethatthefunction f(x)=3x 2 approachesinfinityas x approachesinfinity,andwewrite 3x 2 →∞ as x→∞.
The behavior as x→−∞ and the meaning of f(x)→−∞ as x→∞ or x→−∞ can be defined similarly. We can
describe what happens to the values of f(x) as x→∞ and as x→−∞ as theend behaviorof the function.

is a parabola, the parabola opens upward if a>0; the parabola opens downward if a<0. (SeeFigure 1.19(a).)
Now consider a cubic function f(x)=ax 3 +bx 2 +cx+d. If a>0, then f(x)→∞ as x→∞ and f(x)→−∞
as x→−∞. If a<0, then f(x)→−∞ as x→∞ and f(x)→∞ as x→−∞. Aswecanseefrombothofthese

For each of the following functions, find the domain and range.
a. f(x)= 3x−1
5x+2
b. To find the domain of f , we need 4– x 2 ≥0. Or, 4≥ x 2 Or x 2 ≤4, the solution to which is
–2≤ x≤2. Therefore, the domain is {x|–2≤ x≤2}. If –2≤ x≤2, then 0≤4– x 2 ≤4.
Therefore, 0≤ 4– x 2 ≤2 and the range of f is ⎧ ⎨y|0≤ x≤2⎫ ⎬ .
⎩ ⎭
Solution
a. Itisnotpossibletodividebyzero,sothedomainisthesetofrealnumbers x suchthat x≠−2/5. To
find the range, we need to find the values y for which there exists a real number x such that

5x+2
When we multiply both sides of this equation by 5x+2, we see that x must satisfy the equation
5xy+2y=3x−1.
From this equation, we can see that x must satisfy
2y+1= x(3−5y).
If y=3/5, this equation has no solution. On the other hand, as long as y≠3/5,
2y+1
x=
3−5y
satisfies this equation. We can conclude that the range of f is ⎧ ⎨y|y≠3/5⎫ ⎬.
⎩ ⎭
b. To find the domain of f, we need 4−x 2 ≥0. When we factor, we write
4−x 2 =(2−x)(2+x)≥0. Thisinequalityholdsifandonlyifbothtermsarepositiveorbothterms

2−x≥0 and 2+x≥0.
Thesetwoinequalitiesreduceto 2≥ x and x≥−2. Therefore,theset {x|−2≤ x≤2} mustbepart

these inequalities. Thus, we can conclude the domain of this function is {x|−2≤ x≤2}.
If −2≤ x≤2, then 0≤4−x 2 ≤4. Therefore, 0≤ 4−x 2 ≤2, and the range of f is

Transcendental Functions
Thus far, we have discussed algebraic functions. Some functions, however, cannot be described by basic algebraic
operations. These functions are known as transcendental functions because they are said to “transcend,” or go beyond,
algebra. The most common transcendental functions are trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. A
trigonometricfunctionrelatestheratiosoftwosidesofarighttriangle.Theyare sinx, cosx, tanx, cotx, secx, andcscx.
(We discuss trigonometric functions later in the chapter.) An exponential function is a function of the form f(x)=b x ,
where the base b>0, b≠1. A logarithmic function is a function of the form f(x)=log (x) for some constant
b
b>0, b≠1, where log (x)=y ifandonlyif b y = x. (Wealsodiscussexponentialandlogarithmicfunctionslaterin

3
a. f(x)= x +1

2
b. f(x)=2 x
c. f(x)=sin(2x)
Solution
a. Since this function involves basic algebraic operations only, it is an algebraic function.
b. This function cannot be written as a formula that involves only basic algebraic operations, so it is
transcendental. (Note that algebraic functions can only have powers that are rational numbers.)
c. Asinpartb.,thisfunctioncannotbewrittenusingaformulainvolvingbasicalgebraicoperationsonly;
therefore, this function is transcendental.

We have explored what happens to the graph of a function f when we multiply f by a constant c>0 to get a new
function cf(x). We have also discussed what happens to the graph of a function f when we multiply the independent
variable x by c>0 to get a new function f(cx). However, we have not addressed what happens to the graph of the

Graphs and Periods of the Trigonometric Functions
We have seen that as we travel around the unit circle, the values of the trigonometric functions repeat. We can see this
pattern inthe graphsofthe functions. Let P=(x, y) beapoint onthe unit circle andlet θ bethe corresponding angle
. Since the angle θ and θ+2π correspond to the same point P, the values of the trigonometric functions at θ and
at θ+2π arethesame.Consequently,thetrigonometricfunctionsareperiodicfunctions.Theperiodofafunction f is

following function:

In Figure 1.35, the constant α causes a horizontal or phase shift. The factor B changes the period. This transformed

Existence of an Inverse Function
We begin with an example. Given a function f and an output y= f(x), we are often interested in finding what
value or values x were mapped to y by f. For example, consider the function f(x)= x 3 +4. Since any output
y= x 3 +4, wecansolvethisequationfor x tofindthattheinputis x= 3 y−4. Thisequationdefines x asafunction
of y. Denoting this function as f −1 , and writing x= f −1(y)= 3 y−4, we see that for any x in the domain of
f, f −1⎛f(x)⎞= f −1⎛ x 3 +4 ⎞ = x. Thus,thisnewfunction, f −1 , “undid”whattheoriginalfunction f did.Afunction
⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠
with this property is called the inverse function of the original function.

horizontal line test, it cannot intersect the graph more than once. We note that the horizontal line test is different from
the vertical line test. The vertical line test determines whether agraph is the graph ofafunction. The horizontal line test
determines whether a function is one-to-one (Figure 1.38).
Rule: Horizontal Line Test
A function f is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph of f no more than once.
Figure 1.38 (a) The function f(x)= x 2 is not one-to-one
because it fails the horizontal line test. (b) The function

Finding a Function’s Inverse
We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in
thedomainof f toelementsintherangeof f. Theinversefunctionmapseachelementfromtherangeof f backtoits
correspondingelementfromthedomainof f. Therefore,tofindtheinversefunctionofaone-to-onefunction f, given
any y intherangeof f, weneedtodeterminewhich x inthedomainof f satisfies f(x)=y. Since f isone-to-one,
thereisexactly onesuchvalue x. Wecanfindthatvalue x bysolvingtheequation f(x)=y for x. Doingso,weare
abletowrite x asafunctionof y wherethedomainofthisfunctionistherangeof f andtherangeofthisnewfunction
isthedomainof f. Consequently,thisfunctionistheinverseof f, andwewrite x= f −1 (y). Sincewetypicallyusethe

and y, andwrite y= f −1 (x). Representingtheinversefunctioninthiswayisalsohelpfullaterwhenwegraphafunction
f and its inverse f −1 on the same axes.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding an Inverse Function
1. Solve the equation y= f(x) for x.
2. Interchange the variables x and y and write y= f −1 (x).

Therefore, f −1(x)= 1 x+ 4 .

Sincethedomainof f is (−∞, ∞), therangeof f −1 is (−∞, ∞). Sincetherangeof f is (−∞, ∞), the

Graphing Inverse Functions
Let’s consider the relationship between the graph of a function f and the graph of its inverse. Consider the graph of f
showninFigure 1.39andapoint (a, b) onthegraph.Since b= f(a), then f −1(b)=a. Therefore,whenwegraph
f −1 , the point (b, a) is on the graph. As a result, the graph of f −1 is a reflection of the graph of f about the line
y= x.
Figure 1.39 (a) The graph of this function f shows point (a, b) on the graph of f. (b)
Since (a, b) is on the graph of f, the point (b, a) is on the graph of f −1 . The graph of
f −1 is a reflection of the graph of f about the line y= x.
Example 1.30

Restricting Domains
As we have seen, f(x)= x 2 does not have an inverse function because it is not one-to-one. However, we can choose a
subsetofthedomainof f suchthatthefunctionisone-to-one.Thissubsetiscalledarestricteddomain.Byrestrictingthe
domainof f, wecandefineanewfunction g suchthatthedomainof g istherestricteddomainof f and g(x)= f(x)
forall x inthedomainof g. Thenwecandefineaninversefunctionfor g onthatdomain.Forexample,since f(x)= x 2

forall x initsdomain.Since g isaone-to-onefunction,ithasaninversefunction,givenbytheformula g −1 (x)= x. On
theotherhand,thefunction f(x)= x 2 isalsoone-to-oneonthedomain (−∞, 0]. Therefore,wecouldalsodefineanew
function h suchthatthedomainof h is (−∞, 0] and h(x)= x 2 forall x inthedomainof h. Then h isaone-to-one
function and must also have an inverse. Its inverse is given by the formula h −1 (x)=− x (Figure 1.40).

b. On the interval [−1, ∞), f is one-to-one.

86 Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs
The domain and range of f −1 are given by the range and domain of f, respectively. Therefore, the
domain of f −1 is [0, ∞) and the range of f −1 is [−1, ∞). To find a formula for f −1 , solve the
equation y=(x+1)2 for x. If y=(x+1)2 , then x=−1± y. Sincewearerestrictingthedomain
totheintervalwhere x≥−1, weneed ± y≥0. Therefore, x=−1+ y. Interchanging x and y,
we write y=−1+ x and conclude that f −1(x)=−1+ x.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Thesixbasictrigonometricfunctionsareperiodic,andthereforetheyarenotone-to-one.However,ifwerestrictthedomain
of a trigonometric function to an interval where it is one-to-one, we can define its inverse. Consider the sine function
(Figure1.34).Thesinefunctionisone-to-oneonaninfinitenumberofintervals,butthestandardconventionistorestrict
the domain to the interval ⎡ − π , π⎤ . By doing so, we define the inverse sine function on the domain [−1, 1] such that
⎣ 2 2⎦
for any x in the interval [−1, 1], the inverse sine function tells us which angle θ in the interval ⎡ − π , π⎤ satisfies
⎣ 2 2⎦
sinθ= x. Similarly, we can restrict the domains of the other trigonometric functions to define inverse trigonometric
functions, which are functions that tell us which angle in a certain interval has a specified trigonometric value.
Definition
The inverse sine function, denoted sin −1 or arcsin, and the inverse cosine function, denoted cos −1 or arccos, are
defined on the domain D={x|−1≤ x≤1} as follows:

2 2
sec −1(x)=yif and only ifsec(y)= xand0≤y≤π, y≠π/2.
To graph the inverse trigonometric functions, we use the graphs of the trigonometric functions restricted to the domains
defined earlier and reflect the graphs about the line y= x (Figure 1.41).
Figure 1.41 The graph of each of the inverse trigonometric functions is a reflection about the line y= x of
the corresponding restricted trigonometric function.

is a negative integer, then x=−y for some positive integer y, and we define b x =b −y =1/b y . Also, b 0 is defined
to be 1. If x is a rational number, then x= p/q, where p and q are integers and b x =b p/q = q b p . For example,

Returning to our savings account example, we can conclude that if a person puts P dollars in an account at an annual
interest rate r, compounded continuously, then A(t)=Pe rt . This function may be familiar. Since functions involving
base e arise often in applications, we call the function f(x)=e x the natural exponential function. Not only is this
function interesting because of the definition of the number e, but also, as discussed next, its graph has an important
property.
Since e>1, we know e x is increasing on (−∞, ∞). In Figure 1.45, we show a graph of f(x)=e x along with a

Theexponentialfunction f(x)=b x isone-to-one,withdomain (−∞, ∞) andrange (0, ∞). Therefore,ithasaninverse
function, called the logarithmic function with base b. For any b>0, b≠1, the logarithmic function with base b,
denoted log , has domain (0, ∞) and range (−∞, ∞), and satisfies

log (x)=yif and only ifb y = x.

Furthermore, since y=log (x) and y=b x are inverse functions,
b
log (b x)= xandb logb(x) = x.

The most commonly used logarithmic function is the function loge. Since this function uses natural e as its base, it is
called thenatural logarithm. Here we use the notation ln(x) or lnx to mean loge(x). For example,
⎛ 3⎞ ⎛ 3⎞
ln(e)=loge(e)=1, ln
⎝

⎠
=loge⎝ e
⎠
=3, ln(1)=loge(1)=0.
Since the functions f(x)=e x and g(x)=ln(x) are inverses of each other,
ln(e x)= xande lnx = x,
and their graphs are symmetric about the line y= x (Figure 1.46).
Figure 1.46 The functions y=e x and y=ln(x) are
inverses of each other, so their graphs are symmetric about the
line y= x.

Solving Equations Involving Exponential Functions
Solve each of the following equations for x.
a. 5 x =2
b. e x +6e −x =5
Solution
a. Applying the natural logarithm function to both sides of the equation, we have
x
ln5 =ln2.
Using the power property of logarithms,
xln5=ln2.
Therefore, x=ln2/ln5.
b. Multiplying both sides of the equation by e x , we arrive at the equation
2x x
e +6=5e .

Rewriting this equation as
2x x
e −5e +6=0,
we can then rewrite it as a quadratic equation in e x :
(e x)2 −5(e x)+6=0.
Now we can solve the quadratic equation. Factoring this equation, we obtain
(e x −3)(e x −2)=0.
Therefore,thesolutionssatisfy e x =3 and e x =2. Takingthenaturallogarithmofbothsidesgivesus

tanh(0)=0, −1<tanh(x)<1 for all x, tanhx→1 as x→∞, and tanhx→−1 as x→−∞. The graphs of the
other three hyperbolic functions can be sketched using the graphs of coshx, sinhx, and tanhx (Figure 1.51).

KEY CONCEPTS
1.1Review of Functions
• A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs with exactly one output for each input.
• Ifnodomainisstatedforafunction y= f(x), thedomainisconsideredtobethesetofallrealnumbers x for
which the function is defined.
• When sketching the graph of a function f, each vertical line may intersect the graph, at most, once.
• A function may have any number of zeros, but it has, at most, oney-intercept.
• To define the composition g∘f, the range of f must be contained in the domain of g.
• Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis whereas odd functions are symmetric about the origin.
1.2Basic Classes of Functions
• The power function f(x)= x n is an even function if n is even and n≠0, and it is an odd function if n is odd.
• Therootfunction f(x)= x 1/n hasthedomain [0, ∞) if n isevenandthedomain (−∞, ∞) if n isodd.If n
is odd, then f(x)= x 1/n is an odd function.
• Thedomainoftherationalfunction f(x)= p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) arepolynomialfunctions,istheset
of x such that q(x)≠0.
• Functions that involve the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers are
algebraic functions. All other functions are transcendental. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions
are examples of transcendental functions.
• A polynomial function f with degree n≥1 satisfies f(x)→±∞ as x→±∞. The sign of the output as
x→∞ depends on the sign of the leading coefficient only and on whether n is even or odd.
• Vertical and horizontal shifts, vertical and horizontal scalings, and reflections about the x- and y-axes are
examples of transformations of functions.
1.3Trigonometric Functions
• Radian measure is defined such that the angle associated with the arc of length 1 on the unit circle has radian
measure 1. An angle with a degree measure of 180° has a radian measure of π rad.

120 Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs
• Foracuteangles θ, thevaluesofthetrigonometricfunctionsaredefinedasratiosoftwosidesofarighttriangle
in which one of the acute angles is θ.
• For a general angle θ, let (x, y) be a point on a circle of radius r corresponding to this angle θ. The
trigonometric functions can be written as ratios involving x, y, and r.
• The trigonometric functions are periodic. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have period 2π. The
tangent and cotangent functions have period π.
1.4Inverse Functions

• The graph of a function f and its inverse f −1 are symmetric about the line y= x.
1.5Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
• The exponential function y=b x is increasing if b>1 and decreasing if 0<b<1. Its domain is (−∞, ∞)
and its range is (0, ∞).
• The logarithmic function y=log (x) is the inverse of y=b x . Its domain is (0, ∞) and its range is (−∞, ∞).

• The natural exponential function is y=e x and the natural logarithmic function is y=lnx=logex.
• Given an exponential function or logarithmic function in base a, we can make a change of base to convert this
function to any base b>0, b≠1. We typically convert to base e.

2.1.2 Explain how the idea of a limit is involved in solving the tangent problem.
2.1.3 Recognize a tangent to a curve at a point as the limit of secant lines.

As we embark on our study of calculus, we shall see how its development arose from common solutions to practical
problems in areas such as engineering physics—like the space travel problem posed in the chapter opener. Two key

chapter, armed with a conceptual understanding of limits, we examine the formal definition of a limit.
We begin our exploration of limits by taking a look at the graphs of the functions

more completely, we need to introduce the concept of a limit.

Definition
Let f(x) beafunctiondefinedatallvaluesinanopenintervalcontaininga,withthepossibleexceptionofaitself,
and let L be a real number. If all values of the function f(x) approach the real number L as the values of x(≠a)

Wecanestimatelimitsbyconstructingtablesoffunctionalvaluesandbylookingattheirgraphs.Thisprocessisdescribed
in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values
1. Toevaluate lim f(x), webeginbycompleting atableoffunctionalvalues.Weshouldchoosetwosetsof

thana.Table 2.1demonstrates what your tables might look like.

a−0.01 f(a−0.01) a+0.01 f(a+0.01)
a−0.001 f(a−0.001) a+0.001 f(a+0.001)
a−0.0001 f(a−0.0001) a+0.0001 f(a+0.0001)
Use additional values as necessary. Use additional values as necessary.
Table 2.1Table of Functional Values for lim f(x)
x→a
2. Next, let’s look at the values in each of the f(x) columns and determine whether the values seem to
be approaching a single value as we move down each column. In our columns, we look at the sequence
f(a−0.1), f(a−0.01), f(a−0.001)., f(a−0.0001), and so on, and
f(a+0.1), f(a+0.01), f(a+0.001), f(a+0.0001), and so on. (Note: Although we have chosen the
x-values a±0.1, a±0.01, a±0.001, a±0.0001, andsoforth,andthesevalueswillprobablyworknearly
every time, on very rare occasions we may need to modify our choices.)

Figure 2.15 The graph of g(x) includes one value not on a

Despite the fact that g(−1)=4, as the x-values approach −1 from either side, the g(x) values approach 3.

We can make the following observations about these two limits.
i. For the first limit, observe that asxapproachesa, so does f(x), because f(x)= x. Consequently, lim x=a.
x→a
ii. For the second limit, considerTable 2.4.

After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do not seem to approach any one
single value. It appears the limit does not exist. Before drawing this conclusion, let’s take a more systematic
approach. Take the following sequence ofx-values approaching 0:

π 3π 5π 7π 9π 11π

It is important to understand that when we write statements such as lim f(x)=+∞ or lim f(x)=−∞ we are
x→a x→a
describing the behavior of the function, as we have just defined it. We are not asserting that a limit exists. For the
limit of a function f(x) to exist at a, it must approach a real number L as x approaches a. That said, if, for example,
lim f(x)=+∞, we always write lim f(x)=+∞ rather than lim f(x) DNE.

Figure 2.23 This graph shows the ratio of masses as a
function of the ratio of speeds in Einstein’s equation for the
mass of a moving object.
We can see that as the ratio of speeds approaches 1—that is, as the speed of the object approaches the speed
of light—the ratio of masses increases without bound. In other words, the function has a vertical asymptote at
v/c=1. We can try a few values of this ratio to test this idea.

Consequently, 0< −sinθ<−θ. It follows that 0>sinθ>θ. An application of the squeeze theorem produces the
desired limit. Thus, since lim sinθ=0 and lim sinθ=0,

We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. Think of the regular

Webeginourinvestigationofcontinuitybyexploringwhatitmeansforafunctiontohavecontinuityatapoint.Intuitively,
a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that point.
Continuity at a Point
Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let’s consider various
functionsthatfailtomeetourintuitivenotionofwhatitmeanstobecontinuousatapoint.Wethencreatealistofconditions
that prevent such failures.
Our first function of interest is shown in Figure 2.32. We see that the graph of f(x) has a hole at a. In fact, f(a) is
undefined. At the very least, for f(x) to be continuous ata, we need the following condition:
i. f(a)is defined.
Figure 2.32 The function f(x) is not continuous ata
because f(a) is undefined.
However, as we see in Figure 2.33, this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point a. Although

Now we put our list of conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.
Definition
A function f(x) iscontinuous at a pointaif and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:
i. f(a) is defined
ii. lim f(x) exists
x→a
iii. lim f(x)= f(a)
x→a
A function isdiscontinuous at a pointaif it fails to be continuous ata.
The following procedure can be used to analyze the continuity of a function at a point using this definition.

the conclusion.

Let’s begin by trying to calculate f(2). We can see that f(2)=0/0, which is undefined. Therefore,

Polynomials and rational functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

Types of Discontinuities
As we have seen in Example 2.26 and Example 2.27, discontinuities take on several different appearances. We
classify the types of discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump
discontinuities. Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump
discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite
discontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. Figure 2.37 illustrates the differences in these types of
discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities, keep in
mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.
Figure 2.37 Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite.
These three discontinuities are formally defined as follows:
Definition

Continuity over an Interval
Now that we have explored the concept of continuity at a point, we extend that idea to continuity over an interval. As

Continuity over an Interval
State the interval(s) over which the function f(x)= 4−x 2 is continuous.

Fromthelimitlaws,weknowthat lim 4−x 2 = 4−a 2 forallvaluesofain (−2, 2). Wealsoknowthat

⎣

190 Chapter 2 | Limits
Solution
No. The Intermediate Value Theorem only allows us to conclude that we can find a value between f(0) and
f(2); it doesn’t allow us to conclude that we can’t find other values. To see this more clearly, consider the
function f(x)=(x−1)2 . It satisfies f(0)=1>0, f(2)=1>0, and f(1)=0.
Example 2.38
When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?
For f(x)=1/x, f(−1)=−1<0 and f(1)=1>0. Can we conclude that f(x) has a zero in the interval

Solution
No. The function is not continuous over [−1, 1]. The Intermediate Value Theorem does not apply here.

Quantifying Closeness
Beforestatingtheformaldefinitionofalimit,wemustintroduceafewpreliminaryideas.Recallthatthedistancebetween
two pointsaandbon a number line is given by |a−b|.
• The statement |f(x)−L|<ε may be interpreted as:The distance between f(x) and L is less than ε.
• The statement 0<|x−a|<δ may be interpreted as: x≠a and the distance between x and a is less than δ.
It is also important to look at the following equivalences for absolute value:
• The statement |f(x)−L|<ε is equivalent to the statement L−ε< f(x)<L+ε.
• The statement 0<|x−a|<δ is equivalent to the statement a−δ< x<a+δ and x≠a.
With these clarifications, we can state the formalepsilon-delta definition of the limit.
Definition
Let f(x) be defined for all x≠a over an open interval containinga. LetLbe a real number. Then
lim f(x)=L
x→a
if, for every ε>0, there exists a δ>0, such that if 0<|x−a|<δ, then |f(x)−L|<ε.
This definition may seem rather complex from a mathematical point of view, but it becomes easier to understand if we

Choose δ= ε .

The definition continues with “there exists a δ>0.” The phrase “there exists” in a mathematical statement is
always a signal for a scavenger hunt. In other words, we must go and find δ. So, where exactly did δ=ε/2

Webeginbytacklingtheproblemfromanalgebraicpointofview.Sinceultimatelywewant |(2x+1)−3|<ε,
we begin by manipulating this expression: |(2x+1)−3|<ε is equivalent to |2x−2|<ε, which in turn
is equivalent to |2||x−1|<ε. Last, this is equivalent to |x−1|<ε/2. Thus, it would seem that δ=ε/2 is
appropriate.
We may also find δ through geometric methods.Figure 2.40demonstrates how this is done.
Figure 2.40 This graph shows how we find δ geometrically.
Assume 0<|x−1|<δ. When δ has been chosen, our goal is to show that if 0<|x−1|<δ, then
|(2x+1)−3|<ε. To prove any statement of the form “If this, then that,” we begin by assuming “this” and
trying to get “that.”
Thus,

After removing all the remarks, here is a final version of the proof:
Let ε>0.

Solution
We begin by filling in the blanks where the choices are specified by the definition. Thus, we have
Let ε>0.
Choose δ=_______.
Assume 0<|x−(−1)|<δ. (or equivalently, 0<|x+1|<δ.)
Thus, |(4x+1)−(−3)|=|4x+4|=|4||x+1|<4δ_______ε.
Focusing on the final line of the proof, we see that we should choose δ= ε .

We now complete the final write-up of the proof:
Let ε>0.
Choose δ= ε .
4
Assume 0<|x−(−1)|<δ (or equivalently, 0<|x+1|<δ.)
Thus, |(4x+1)−(−3)|=|4x+4|=|4||x+1|<4δ=4(ε/4)=ε.

Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Geometric Approach)
Prove that lim x 2 =4.

Solution
1. Let ε>0. The first part of the definition begins “For every ε>0,” so we must prove that whatever

to do so.

3. Choose δ=min⎧ ⎨2− 4−ε, 4+ε−2⎫ ⎬. Figure 2.41shows how we made this choice of δ.
⎩ ⎭
Figure 2.41 This graph shows how we find δ geometrically for a given ε
for the proof inExample 2.41.
4. We must show: If 0<|x−2|<δ, then |x 2 −4|<ε, so we must begin by assuming
0<|x−2|<δ.
We don’t really need 0<|x−2| (in other words, x≠2) for this proof. Since
0<|x−2|<δ⇒|x−2|<δ, it is okay to drop 0<|x−2|.
|x−2|<δ.
Hence,
−δ< x−2<δ.
Recall that δ=min⎧ ⎨2− 4−ε, 4+ε−2⎫ ⎬. Thus, δ≤2− 4−ε and consequently
⎩ ⎭
−⎛2− 4−ε⎞≤ −δ. We also use δ≤ 4+ε−2 here. We might ask at this point: Why did we
⎝ ⎠
substitute 2− 4−ε for δ on the left-hand side of the inequality and 4+ε−2 on the right-hand
sideoftheinequality?IfwelookatFigure2.41,weseethat 2− 4−ε correspondstothedistanceon

the left of 2 on thex-axis and 4+ε−2 corresponds to the distance on the right. Thus,
−⎛2− 4−ε⎞≤ −δ< x−2<δ≤ 4+ε−2.
⎝ ⎠
We simplify the expression on the left:
−2+ 4−ε< x−2< 4+ε−2.
Then, we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
4−ε< x< 4+ε.
We square all parts of the inequality. It is okay to do so, since all parts of the inequality are positive:
2
4−ε< x <4+ε.
We subtract 4 from all parts of the inequality:

−ε< x −4<ε.
Last,

to |x+1|·|x−3|<ε. At this point, the temptation simply to choose δ= ε is very strong.

Unfortunately,ourchoiceof δ mustdependonεonlyandnoothervariable.Ifwecanreplace |x−3| by

The choice of δ≤1 here is arbitrary.We could have just as easily used any other positive number.In
someproofs,greatercareinthischoicemaybenecessary.Now,since δ≤1 and |x+1|<δ≤1, we
are able to show that |x−3|<5. Consequently, |x+1|·|x−3|<|x+1|·5. At this point we realize
that we also need δ≤ε/5. Thus, we choose δ=min{1, ε/5}.
3. Assume 0<|x+1|<δ. Thus,
ε
|x+1|<1and|x+1|< .
5
Since |x+1|<1, wemayconcludethat −1< x+1<1. Thus,bysubtracting4fromallpartsofthe
inequality, we obtain −5< x−3<−1. Consequently, |x−3|<5. This gives us

x→1
Let ε>0; choose δ=min{1, ε/3}; assume 0<|x−1|<δ.
Since |x−1|<1, we may conclude that −1< x−1<1. Thus, 1< x+1<3. Hence, |x+1|<3.

Learning Objectives
3.1.1 Recognize the meaning of the tangent to a curve at a point.
3.1.2 Calculate the slope of a tangent line.
3.1.3 Identify the derivative as the limit of a difference quotient.
3.1.4 Calculate the derivative of a given function at a point.

3.1.6 Explain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
3.1.7 Estimate the derivative from a table of values.
Nowthatwehavebothaconceptualunderstandingofalimitandthepracticalabilitytocomputelimits,wehaveestablished
the foundation for our study of calculus, the branch of mathematics in which we compute derivatives and integrals.
Most mathematicians and historians agree that calculus was developed independently by the Englishman Isaac Newton
(1643–1727) and the German Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), whose images appear in Figure 3.2. When we credit
Newton and Leibniz with developing calculus, we are really referring to the fact that Newton and Leibniz were the first
to understand the relationship between the derivative and the integral. Both mathematicians benefited from the work of
predecessors, such as Barrow, Fermat, and Cavalieri. The initial relationship between the two mathematicians appears to
have been amicable; however, in later years a bitter controversy erupted over whose work took precedence. Although it
seemslikelythatNewtondid,indeed,arriveattheideasbehindcalculusfirst,weareindebtedtoLeibnizforthenotation
that we commonly use today.
Figure 3.2 Newton and Leibniz are credited with developing calculus independently.

Tangent Lines
Webeginourstudyofcalculusbyrevisitingthenotionofsecantlinesandtangentlines.Recallthatweusedtheslopeof
asecantlinetoafunctionatapoint (a, f(a)) toestimatetherateofchange,ortherateatwhichonevariablechangesin
relation to another variable. We can obtain the slope of the secant by choosing a value of x near a and drawing a line
throughthepoints (a, f(a)) and ⎛x, f(x)⎞, asshowninFigure3.3.Theslopeofthislineisgivenbyanequationinthe

form of a difference quotient:
f(x)− f(a)
msec=
x−a
.
We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and replacing x with
a+h, where h is a value close to 0. We can then calculate the slope of the line through the points (a, f(a)) and
(a+h, f(a+h)). In this case, we find the secant line has a slope given by the following difference quotient with
increment h:
f(a+h)− f(a) f(a+h)− f(a)
msec=
a+h−a
=

.
Definition
Let f be a function defined on an interval I containing a. If x≠a is in I, then
f(x)− f(a) (3.1)
Q=

is adifference quotient.
Also, if h≠0 is chosen so that a+h is in I, then
f(a+h)− f(a) (3.2)

is a difference quotient with increment h.

Using the point-slope equation of the line with the slope m=6 and the point (3, 9), we obtain the line
y−9=6(x−3). Simplifying, we have y=6x−9. The graph of f(x)= x 2 and its tangent line at 3 are
shown inFigure 3.6.

Rate of Change of Profit
A toy company can sell x electronic gaming systems at a price of p=−0.01x+400 dollars per gaming
system.Thecostofmanufacturing x systemsisgivenby C(x)=100x+10,000 dollars.Findtherateofchange

Solution
Theprofit P(x) earnedbyproducing x gamingsystemsis R(x)−C(x), where R(x) istherevenueobtained
from the sale of x games. Since the company can sell x games at p=−0.01x+400 per game,
R(x)= xp= x(−0.01x+400)=−0.01x 2 +400x.
Consequently,
P(x)=−0.01x 2 +300x−10,000.
Therefore, evaluating the rate of change of profit gives
P(x)−P(10000)
P′(10000) = lim

Since the rate of change of profit P′(10,000)>0 and P(10,000)>0, the company should increase
production.

3.6 Find the derivative of f(x)= x 2 .
We use a variety of different notations to express the derivative of a function. In Example 3.12 we showed that if
f(x)= x 2 −2x, then f′(x)=2x−2. If we had expressed this function in the form y= x 2 −2x, we could have
dy
expressed the derivative as y′=2x−2 or =2x−2. We could have conveyed the same information by writing
dx
d ⎛ x 2 −2x ⎞ =2x−2. Thus, for the function y= f(x), each of the following notations represents the derivative of
dx⎝ ⎠
f(x):

234 Chapter 3 | Derivatives
f′(x), dy , y′, d ⎛f(x)⎞.
dx dx⎝ ⎠
In place of f′(a) we may also use

Use of the

with respect to x, is expressed as

Graphing a Derivative
We have already discussed how to graph a function, so given the equation of a function or the equation of a derivative
function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the graphs of these two
functions, since f′(x) gives the rate of change of a function f(x) (or slope of the tangent line to f(x)).
InExample3.11wefoundthatfor f(x)= x, f′(x)=1/2 x. Ifwegraphthesefunctionsonthesameaxes,asinFigure
3.12, we can use the graphs to understand the relationship between these two functions. First, we notice that f(x) is
increasingoveritsentiredomain,whichmeansthattheslopesofitstangentlinesatallpointsarepositive.Consequently,
weexpect f′(x)>0 forallvaluesof x initsdomain.Furthermore,as x increases,theslopesofthetangentlinesto f(x)

at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons.
Theorem 3.1:Differentiability Implies Continuity
Let f(x) be a function and a be in its domain. If f(x) is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.
Proof
If f(x) is differentiable at a, then f′(a) exists and
f(x)− f(a)
f′(a)= lim .
x→a x−a
We want to show that f(x) is continuous at a by showing that lim f(x)= f(a). Thus,
x→a
lim f(x) = lim ⎛f(x)− f(a)+ f(a)⎞
x→a x→a⎝ ⎠
⎛f(x)− f(a) ⎞
= lim ·(x−a)+ f(a) Multiply and divide f(x)− f(a)byx−a.
x→a⎝ x−a ⎠
⎛ f(x)− f(a)⎞ ⎛ ⎞
= lim · lim (x−a) + lim f(a)
⎝x→a x−a ⎠ ⎝x→a ⎠ x→a
= f′(a)·0+ f(a)
= f(a).
Therefore, since f(a) is defined and lim f(x)= f(a), we conclude that f is continuous at a.
x→a
□
We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies
differentiability.Todetermineananswertothisquestion,weexaminethefunction f(x)=|x|. Thisfunctioniscontinuous
everywhere; however, f′(0) is undefined. This observation leads us to believe that continuity does not imply
differentiability. Let’s explore further. For f(x)=|x|,
f(x)− f(0) |x|−|0| |x|
f′(0)= lim = lim = lim .
x→0 x−0 x→0 x−0 x→0 x
This limit does not exist because
|x| |x|
lim =−1and lim =1.
x→0 − x x→0 + x
SeeFigure 3.14.

238 Chapter 3 | Derivatives
Figure 3.14 The function f(x)=|x| is continuous at 0 but
is not differentiable at 0.
Let’s consider some additional situations in which a continuous function fails to be differentiable. Consider the function

Thus f′(0) does not exist. A quick look at the graph of f(x)= 3 x clarifies the situation. The function has a vertical
tangent line at 0 (Figure 3.15).

to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for differentiating these basic functions.
The Constant Rule
We first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, f(x)=c. For this
function, both f(x)=c and f(x+h)=c, so we obtain the following result:
f(x+h)− f(x)

unwisetodrawgeneralconclusionsfromspecificexamples,wenotethatwhenwedifferentiate f(x)= x 3 , thepoweron
x becomes the coefficient of x 2 in the derivative and the power on x in the derivative decreases by 1. The following
theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of x. We will eventually extend this result to
negative integer powers. Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended first to rational powers of x and then to
arbitrary powers of x. Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to functions in which a constant is raised to a
variable power, such as f(x)=3 x .
Theorem 3.3:The Power Rule

We provide only the proof of the sum rule here. The rest follow in a similar manner.
For differentiable functions f(x) and g(x), we set j(x)= f(x)+g(x). Using the limit definition of the derivative we
have
j(x+h)− j(x)
j′(x)= lim .
h→0 h
By substituting j(x+h)= f(x+h)+g(x+h) and j(x)= f(x)+g(x), we obtain
⎛f(x+h)+g(x+h)⎞−⎛f(x)+g(x)⎞
j′(x)= lim ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠.

Rearranging and regrouping the terms, we have
⎛f(x+h)− f(x) g(x+h)−g(x)⎞
j′(x)= lim + .

We now apply the sum law for limits and the definition of the derivative to obtain

j′(x)= lim + lim = f′(x)+g′(x).

Chapter 3 | Derivatives 253
Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f(x)= x 2 −4x+6 at x=1.
Solution
To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. To find the point, compute
f(1)=1 2 −4(1)+6=3.
Thisgivesusthepoint (1, 3). Sincetheslopeofthetangentlineat1is f′(1), wemustfirstfind f′(x). Using
the definition of a derivative, we have
f′(x)=2x−4
so the slope of the tangent line is f′(1)=−2. Using the point-slope formula, we see that the equation of the
tangent line is
y−3=−2(x−1).
Putting the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, we obtain
y=−2x+5.
3.15 Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f(x)=3x 2 −11 at x=2. Use the point-slope
form.
The Product Rule
Now that we have examined the basic rules, we can begin looking at some of the more advanced rules. The first one
examines the derivative of the product of two functions. Although it might be tempting to assume that the derivative of
theproductistheproductofthederivatives,similartothesumanddifferencerules,theproductruledoesnotfollowthis

Theorem 3.5:Product Rule
Let f(x) and g(x) be differentiable functions. Then
d ⎛f(x)g(x)⎞= d ⎛f(x)⎞·g(x)+ d ⎛g(x)⎞· f(x).
dx⎝ ⎠ dx⎝ ⎠ dx⎝ ⎠
That is,
if j(x)= f(x)g(x), then j′(x)= f′(x)g(x)+g′(x)f(x).
This means that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second
function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.
Proof
We begin by assuming that f(x) and g(x) are differentiable functions. At a key point in this proof we need to use the
fact that, since g(x) is differentiable, it is also continuous. In particular, we use the fact that since g(x) is continuous,
lim g(x+h)=g(x).
h→0

254 Chapter 3 | Derivatives
By applying the limit definition of the derivative to j(x)= f(x)g(x), we obtain
f(x+h)g(x+h)− f(x)g(x)
j′(x)= lim .
h→0 h
By adding and subtracting f(x)g(x+h) in the numerator, we have
f(x+h)g(x+h)− f(x)g(x+h)+ f(x)g(x+h)− f(x)g(x)
j′(x)= lim .
h→0 h
After breaking apart this quotient and applying the sum law for limits, the derivative becomes
⎛f(x+h)g(x+h)− f(x)g(x+h)⎞ ⎛f(x)g(x+h)− f(x)g(x)⎞
j′(x)= lim + lim .
h→0 ⎝ h ⎠ h→0 ⎝ h ⎠
Rearranging, we obtain
⎛f(x+h)− f(x) ⎞ ⎛g(x+h)−g(x) ⎞
j′(x)= lim ·g(x+h) + lim · f(x) .
h→0 ⎝ h ⎠ h→0 ⎝ h ⎠
Byusingthecontinuityof g(x), thedefinitionofthederivativesof f(x) and g(x), andapplyingthelimitlaws,wearrive
at the product rule,
j′(x)= f′(x)g(x)+g′(x)f(x).
□
Example 3.23
Applying the Product Rule to Functions at a Point
For j(x)= f(x)g(x), use the product rule to find j′(2) if f(2)=3, f′(2)=−4, g(2)=1, and g′(2)=6.
Solution
Since j(x)= f(x)g(x), j′(x)= f′(x)g(x)+g′(x)f(x), and hence
j′(2)= f′(2)g(2)+g′(2)f(2)=(−4)(1)+(6)(3)=14.
Example 3.24
Applying the Product Rule to Binomials
For j(x)=(x 2 +2)(3x 3 −5x), find j′(x) by applying the product rule. Check the result by first finding the
product and then differentiating.
Solution
If we set f(x)= x 2 +2 and g(x)=3x 3 −5x, then f′(x)=2x and g′(x)=9x 2 −5. Thus,
j′(x)= f′(x)g(x)+g′(x)f(x)=(2x) ⎛ 3x 3 −5x ⎞ +(9x 2 −5)(x 2 +2).
⎝ ⎠
Simplifying, we have

Determining Where a Function Has a Horizontal Tangent
Determine the values of x for which f(x)= x 3 −7x 2 +8x+1 has a horizontal tangent line.
Solution
To find the values of x for which f(x) has a horizontal tangent line, we must solve f′(x)=0. Since
f′(x)=3x 2 −14x+8=(3x−2)(x−4),
we must solve (3x−2)(x−4)=0. Thus we see that the function has horizontal tangent lines at x= 2 and

Amount of Change Formula
One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a

Theaveragerateofchangeofthefunction f overthatsameintervalistheratiooftheamountofchangeoverthatinterval
to the corresponding change in the x values. It is given by
f(a+h)− f(a)
.
h
As we already know, the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at a is its derivative
f(a+h)− f(a)
f′(a)= lim .
h→0 h
f(a+h)− f(a)
For small enough values of h, f′(a)≈ . We can then solve for f(a+h) to get the amount of change

formula:
f(a+h)≈ f(a)+ f′(a)h. (3.10)

Chapter 3 | Derivatives 267
Figure 3.22 The new value of a changed quantity equals the
original value plus the rate of change times the interval of
change: f(a+h)≈ f(a)+ f′(a)h.
Here is an interestingdemonstration (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_chainrule)of rate of change.
Example 3.33
Estimating the Value of a Function
If f(3)=2 and f′(3)=5, estimate f(3.2).
Solution
Begin by finding h. We have h=3.2−3=0.2. Thus,
f(3.2)= f(3+0.2)≈ f(3)+(0.2)f′(3)=2+0.2(5)=3.
3.21 Given f(10)=−5 and f′(10)=6, estimate f(10.1).

Definition
Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time t.
The velocity of the object at time t is given by v(t)=s′(t).
The speed of the object at time t is given by |v(t)|.
The acceleration of the object at t is given by a(t)=v′(t)=s″(t).

Example 3.34
Comparing Instantaneous Velocity and Average Velocity
A ball is dropped from a height of 64 feet. Its height above ground (in feet) t seconds later is given by
s(t)=−16t 2 +64.
a. What is the instantaneous velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?
b. What is the average velocity during its fall?
Solution
Thefirstthingtodoisdeterminehowlongittakestheballtoreachtheground.Todothis,set s(t)=0. Solving
−16t 2 +64=0, we get t=2, so it take 2 seconds for the ball to reach the ground.
a. Theinstantaneous velocity oftheballasitstrikesthegroundis v(2). Since v(t)=s′(t)=−32t, we
obtain v(t)=−64ft/s.

a. Is the particle moving from left to right or from right to left at time t=1?
b. Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at time t=1?
Solution
Begin by finding v(t) and a(t).

Chapter 3 | Derivatives 269
v(t)=s′(t)=3t 2 -4 and a(t)=v′(t)=s″(t)=6t.
Evaluating these functions at t=1, we obtain v(1)=−1 and a(1)=6.
a. Because v(1)<0, the particle is moving from right to left.
b. Because v(1)<0 and a(1)>0, velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions. In other
words, the particle is being accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is traveling,
causing |v(t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing down.
Example 3.36
Position and Velocity
The position of a particle moving along a coordinate axis is given by s(t)=t 3 −9t 2 +24t+4, t≥0.
a. Find v(t).
b. At what time(s) is the particle at rest?
c. On what time intervals is the particle moving from left to right? From right to left?
d. Use the information obtained to sketch the path of the particle along a coordinate axis.
Solution
a. The velocity is the derivative of the position function:
v(t)=s′(t)=3t 2 −18t+24.
b. The particle is at rest when v(t)=0, so set 3t 2 −18t+24=0. Factoring the left-hand side of the
equation produces 3(t−2)(t−4)=0. Solving, we find that the particle is at rest at t=2 and t=4.
c. Theparticle ismovingfromlefttorightwhen v(t)>0 andfromrighttoleftwhen v(t)<0. Figure

Figure 3.23 The sign of v(t) determines the direction of the

Since 3t 2 −18t+24>0 on [0, 2)∪(2, +∞), the particle is moving from left to right on these
intervals.
Since 3t 2 −18t+24<0 on (2, 4), the particle is moving from right to left on this interval.
d. Before we can sketch the graph of the particle, we need to know its position at the time it starts

Population Change
In addition to analyzing velocity, speed, acceleration, and position, we can use derivatives to analyze various types of
populations, including those as diverse as bacteria colonies and cities. We can use a current population, together with a
growthrate,toestimatethesizeofapopulationinthefuture.Thepopulationgrowthrateistherateofchangeofapopulation
and consequently can be represented by the derivative of the size of the population.
Definition
If P(t) is the number of entities present in a population, then the population growth rate of P(t) is defined to be
P′(t).
Example 3.37
Estimating a Population
Thepopulationofacityistriplingevery5years.Ifitscurrentpopulationis10,000,whatwillbeitsapproximate
population 2 years from now?
Solution
Let P(t) bethepopulation(inthousands) t yearsfromnow.Thus,weknowthat P(0)=10 andbasedonthe
information, we anticipate P(5)=30. Now estimate P′(0), the current growth rate, using
P(5)−P(0) 30−10
P′(0)≈ = =4.
5−0 5
By applyingEquation 3.10to P(t), we can estimate the population 2 years from now by writing
P(2)≈P(0)+(2)P′(0)≈10+2(4)=18;
thus, in 2 years the population will be 18,000.
3.23 The current population of a mosquito colony is known to be 3,000; that is, P(0)=3,000. If
P′(0)=100, estimate the size of the population in 3 days, where t is measured in days.

Changes in Cost and Revenue
In addition to analyzing motion along a line and population growth, derivatives are useful in analyzing changes in cost,
revenue,andprofit.Theconceptofamarginalfunctioniscommoninthefieldsofbusinessandeconomicsandimpliesthe
use of derivatives. The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function. The marginal revenue is the derivative of the
revenuefunction.Themarginalprofitisthederivative oftheprofitfunction,whichisbasedonthecostfunctionandthe
revenue function.
Definition
If C(x) is the cost of producingxitems, then themarginal cost MC(x) is MC(x)=C′(x).
If R(x) is the revenue obtained from selling x items, then the marginal revenue MR(x) is MR(x)=R′(x).
If P(x)=R(x)−C(x) istheprofitobtainedfromsellingxitems,thenthemarginalprofit MP(x) isdefinedtobe
MP(x)=P′(x)=MR(x)−MC(x)=R′(x)−C′(x).
We can roughly approximate
C(x+h)−C(x)
MC(x)=C′(x)= lim
h→0 h
by choosing an appropriate value for h. Since x represents objects, a reasonable and small value for h is 1. Thus, by
substituting h=1, we get the approximation MC(x)=C′(x)≈C(x+1)−C(x). Consequently, C′(x) for a given
value of x can be thought of as the change in cost associated with producing one additional item. In a similar way,
MR(x)=R′(x) approximatestherevenueobtainedbysellingoneadditionalitem,and MP(x)=P′(x) approximatesthe
profit obtained by producing and selling one additional item.
Example 3.38
Applying Marginal Revenue
Assumethatthenumberofbarbequedinnersthatcanbesold, x, canberelatedtothepricecharged, p, bythe
equation p(x)=9−0.03x, 0≤ x≤300.
In this case, the revenue in dollars obtained by selling x barbeque dinners is given by
R(x)= xp(x)= x(9−0.03x)=−0.03x 2 +9xfor0≤ x≤300.
Use the marginal revenue function to estimate the revenue obtained from selling the 101st barbeque dinner.
Compare this to the actual revenue obtained from the sale of this dinner.
Solution
First, find the marginal revenue function: MR(x)=R′(x)=−0.06x+9.
Next,use R′(100) toapproximate R(101)−R(100), therevenueobtainedfromthesaleofthe101stdinner.
Since R′(100)=3, the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately $3.
The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is
R(101)−R(100)=602.97−600=2.97, or$2.97.
The marginal revenue is a fairly good estimate in this case and has the advantage of being easy to compute.

Oneofthemostimportant typesofmotion inphysics issimple harmonic motion, whichisassociated withsuchsystems

cosine functions will enable us to find the velocity and acceleration of simple harmonic motion.
Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine Functions
We begin our exploration of the derivative for the sine function by using the formula to make a reasonable guess at its
derivative. Recall that for a function f(x),
f(x+h)− f(x)
f′(x)= lim .
h→0 h
f(x+h)− f(x)
Consequently, for values of h very close to 0, f′(x)≈ . We see that by using h=0.01,

Upon inspection, the graph of D(x) appears to be very close to the graph of the cosine function. Indeed, we will show that

Solution
To determine when the particle is at rest, set s′(t)=v(t)=0. Begin by finding s′(t). We obtain
s′(t)=2cost−1,
so we must solve

Composites of Three or More Functions
We can now combine the chain rule with other rules for differentiating functions, but when we are differentiating the

Solution
To find v(t), the velocity of the particle at time t, we must differentiate s(t). Thus,
v(t)=s′(t)=2cos(2t)−3sin(3t).
Substituting t= π into v(t), we obtain v ⎛π⎞ =−2.

Webeginbyconsideringafunctionanditsinverse.If f(x) isbothinvertibleanddifferentiable,itseemsreasonablethat
the inverse of f(x) is also differentiable. Figure 3.28 shows the relationship between a function f(x) and its inverse

differentiating both sides of this equation (using the chain rule on the right), we obtain

First of all, we begin with the assumption that the function B(x)=b x , b>0, is defined for every real number and is
continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined—beginning
with the definition of b n , where n is a positive integer—as the product of b multiplied by itself n times. Later,
we defined b 0 =1, b −n = 1 , for a positive integer n, and b s/t =( t b) s for positive integers s and t. These
n
b
definitionsleaveopenthequestionofthevalueof b r where r isanarbitraryrealnumber.Byassumingthecontinuityof
B(x)=b x , b>0, wemayinterpret b r as limb x wherethevaluesof x aswetakethelimitarerational.Forexample,
x→r
we may view 4 π as the number satisfying
3 π 4 3.1 π 3.2 3.14 π 3.15

3.141 π 3.142 3.1415 π 3.1416
4 <4 <4 , 4 <4 <4 ,….
As we see in the following table, 4 π ≈77.88.

Table 3.6Approximating a Value of 4 π
We also assume that for B(x)=b x , b>0, the value B′(0) of the derivative exists. In this section, we show that by
making this one additional assumption, it is possible to prove that the function B(x) is differentiable everywhere.
We make one final assumption: that there is a unique value of b>0 for which B′(0)=1. We define e to be this
unique value, as we did in Introduction to Functions and Graphs. Figure 3.33 provides graphs of the functions
y=2 x , y=3 x , y=2.7 x , and y=2.8 x . A visual estimate of the slopes of the tangent lines to these functions at 0

Weseethatonthebasisoftheassumptionthat B(x)=b x isdifferentiableat 0, B(x) isnotonlydifferentiableeverywhere,
but its derivative is
B′(x)=b x B′(0). (3.29)
For E(x)=e x , E′(0)=1. Thus, we have E′(x)=e x . (The value of B′(0) for an arbitrary function of the form
B(x)=b x , b>0, will be derived later.)

In Leibniz’s notation this rule takes the form

• When applied to the composition of three functions, the chain rule can be expressed as follows: If

A rocket launch involves two related quantities that change over time. Being able to solve this type of problem is just
one application of derivatives introduced in this chapter. We also look at how derivatives are used to find maximum and
minimum values of functions. As a result, we will be able to solve applied optimization problems, such as maximizing

Learning Objectives
4.1.1 Express changing quantities in terms of derivatives.
4.1.2 Find relationships among the derivatives in a given problem.
4.1.3 Use the chain rule to find the rate of change of one quantity that depends on the rate of
change of other quantities.
We have seen that for quantities that are changing over time, the rates at which these quantities change are given by
derivatives. If two related quantities are changing over time, the rates at which the quantities change are related. For
example,ifaballoonisbeingfilledwithair,boththeradiusoftheballoonandthevolumeoftheballoonareincreasing.
In this section, we consider several problems in which two or more related quantities are changing and we study how to
determine the relationship between the rates of change of these quantities.
Setting up Related-Rates Problems
In many real-world applications, related quantities are changing with respect to time. For example, if we consider the

Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving a Related-Rates Problem
1. Assign symbols to all variables involved in the problem. Draw a figure if applicable.
2. State, in terms of the variables, the information that is given and the rate to be determined.
3. Find an equation relating the variables introduced in step 1.

5. Substitute all known values into the equation from step 4, then solve for the unknown rate of change.
Note that when solving a related-rates problem, it is crucial not to substitute known values too soon. For example, if the

An Airplane Flying at a Constant Elevation
An airplane is flying overhead at a constant elevation of 4000ft. A man is viewing the plane from a position

Solution
Step 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different quantities involved.
Figure 4.3 An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance between the
person and the airplane and the person and the place on the ground directly below the airplane
are changing. We denote those quantities with the variables s and x, respectively.
Asshown, x denotesthedistancebetweenthemanandthepositiononthegrounddirectlybelowtheairplane.
The variable s denotes the distance between the man and the plane. Note that both x and s are functions of
time. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the plane because it remains at a constant elevation of

Linear Approximation of a Function at a Point
Considerafunction f thatisdifferentiableatapoint x=a. Recallthatthetangentlinetothegraphof f at a isgiven
by the equation
y= f(a)+ f′(a)(x−a).
Forexample,considerthefunction f(x)= 1 at a=2. Since f isdifferentiableat x=2 and f′(x)= − 1 , wesee
x 2

that f′(2)= − 1 . Therefore, the tangent line to the graph of f at a=2 is given by the equation

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 355
Figure 4.7 (a) The tangent line to f(x)=1/x at x=2 provides a good approximation to f for x near 2.
(b) At x=2.1, the value of y on the tangent line to f(x)=1/x is 0.475. The actual value of f(2.1) is
1/2.1, which is approximately 0.47619.
In general, for a differentiable function f, the equation of the tangent line to f at x=a can be used to approximate
f(x) for x near a. Therefore, we can write
f(x)≈ f(a)+ f′(a)(x−a)forxneara.
We call the linear function
L(x)= f(a)+ f′(a)(x−a) (4.1)
the linear approximation, or tangent line approximation, of f at x=a. This function L is also known as the
linearizationof f at x=a.
To show how useful the linear approximation can be, we look at how to find the linear approximation for f(x)= x at
x=9.
Example 4.5
Linear Approximation of
x
Find the linear approximation of f(x)= x at x=9 and use the approximation to estimate 9.1.
Solution
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at x=9, using Equation 4.1 we know the linear
approximation is given by
L(x)= f(9)+ f′(9)(x−9).
We need to find f(9) and f′(9).

Therefore, the linear approximation is given byFigure 4.8.

Using the linear approximation, we can estimate 9.1 by writing

9.1= f(9.1)≈L(9.1)=3+ (9.1−9)≈3.0167.

Figure 4.8 The local linear approximation to f(x)= x at
x=9 provides an approximation to f for x near 9.
Analysis
Using a calculator, the value of 9.1 to four decimal places is 3.0166. The value given by the linear
approximation, 3.0167, is very close to the value obtained with a calculator, so it appears that using this linear
approximationisagoodwaytoestimate x, atleastfor x near 9. Atthesametime,itmayseemoddtouse

Computing differentials
For each of the following functions, finddyand evaluate when x=3 and dx=0.1.
a. y= x 2 +2x
b. y=cosx
Solution
The key step is calculating the derivative. When we have that, we can obtaindydirectly.
a. Since f(x)= x 2 +2x, we know f′(x)=2x+2, and therefore
dy=(2x+2)dx.
When x=3 and dx=0.1,
dy=(2·3+2)(0.1)=0.8.
b. Since f(x)=cosx, f′(x)=−sin(x). This gives us
dy=−sinxdx.
When x=3 and dx=0.1,
dy=−sin(3)(0.1)=−0.1sin(3).
4.8 2
For y=e x , find dy.
Wenowconnect differentials tolinear approximations. Differentials can beused toestimate the change inthe value ofa
function resulting from a small change in input values. Consider a function f that is differentiable at point a. Suppose
theinput x changes byasmall amount. Weareinterested inhowmuchtheoutput y changes. If x changes from a to
a+dx, then the change in x is dx (also denoted Δx), and the change in y is given by
Δy= f(a+dx)− f(a).
Insteadofcalculatingtheexactchangein y, however,itisofteneasiertoapproximatethechangein y byusingalinear
approximation. For x near a, f(x) can be approximated by the linear approximation
L(x)= f(a)+ f′(a)(x−a).
Therefore, if dx is small,
f(a+dx)≈L(a+dx)= f(a)+ f′(a)(a+dx−a).

360 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
That is,
f(a+dx)− f(a)≈L(a+dx)− f(a)= f′(a)dx.
In other words, the actual change in the function f if x increases from a to a+dx is approximately the difference
between L(a+dx) and f(a), where L(x) isthelinearapproximationof f at a. Bydefinitionof L(x), thisdifference
is equal to f′(a)dx. In summary,
Δy= f(a+dx)− f(a)≈L(a+dx)− f(a)= f′(a)dx=dy.
Therefore, we can use the differential dy= f′(a)dx to approximate the change in y if x increases from x=a to
x=a+dx. We can see this in the following graph.
Figure 4.11 The differential dy= f′(a)dx is used to approximate the actual
change in y if x increases from a to a+dx.
Wenowtakealookathowtousedifferentialstoapproximatethechangeinthevalueofthefunctionthatresultsfroma

of functions and the result is very close to what we would obtain with the more exact calculation.
Example 4.9
Approximating Change with Differentials
Let y= x 2 +2x. Compute Δy anddyat x=3 if dx=0.1.
Solution
The actual change in y if x changes from x=3 to x=3.1 is given by
2 2
Δy= f(3.1)− f(3)=[(3.1) +2(3.1)]−[3 +2(3)]=0.81.
The approximate change in y is given by dy= f′(3)dx. Since f′(x)=2x+2, we have
dy= f′(3)dx=(2(3)+2)(0.1)=0.8.
4.9 For y= x 2 +2x, find Δy and dy at x=3 if dx=0.2.

Solution
a. The measurement of the side length is accurate to within ±0.1 cm. Therefore,

The volume of a cube is given by V = x 3 , which leads to

Using the measured side length of 5 cm, we can estimate that

V(5.1)=(5.1) =132.651cm .
Therefore, the actual volume of the cube is between 117.649 and 132.651. Since the side length is

Given a particular function, we are often interested in determining the largest and smallest values of the function. This
information is important in creating accurate graphs. Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function also
has practical significance because we can use this method to solve optimization problems, such as maximizing profit,
minimizingtheamountofmaterialusedinmanufacturinganaluminumcan,orfindingthemaximumheightarocketcan
reach. In this section, we look at how to use derivatives to find the largest and smallest values for a function.
Absolute Extrema
Consider the function f(x)= x 2 +1 over the interval (−∞, ∞). As x→±∞, f(x)→∞. Therefore, the function
does not have a largest value. However, since x 2 +1≥1 for all real numbers x and x 2 +1=1 when x=0, the
functionhasasmallestvalue,1,when x=0. Wesaythat1istheabsoluteminimumof f(x)= x 2 +1 anditoccursat
x=0. We say that f(x)= x 2 +1 does not have an absolute maximum (see the following figure).
Figure 4.12 The given function has an absolute minimum of 1
at x=0. The function does not have an absolute maximum.
Definition
Let f beafunctiondefinedoveraninterval I andlet c∈I. Wesay f hasanabsolutemaximumon I at c if

Considerthefunction f showninFigure4.14.Thegraphcanbedescribedastwomountainswithavalleyinthemiddle.
The absolute maximum value of the function occurs at the higher peak, at x=2. However, x=0 is also a point of
interest.Although f(0) isnotthelargestvalueof f, thevalue f(0) islargerthan f(x) forall x near0.Wesay f hasa

Figure 4.14 This function f has two local maxima and one
local minimum. The local maximum at x=2 is also the
absolute maximum.
Definition
A function f has a local maximum at c if there exists an open interval I containing c such that I is contained

Toanswerthisquestion,let’slookatFigure4.14again.Thelocalextremaoccurat x=0, x=1, and x=2. Notice
that at x=0 and x=1, the derivative f′(x)=0. At x=2, the derivative f′(x) does not exist, since the function
f hasacornerthere.Infact,if f hasalocalextremumatapoint x=c, thederivative f′(c) mustsatisfyoneofthe

in finding extreme values for functions.
Definition
Let c be an interior point in the domain of f. We say that c is a critical point of f if f′(c)=0 or f′(c) is
undefined.
Asmentionedearlier,if f hasalocalextremumatapoint x=c, then c mustbeacriticalpointof f. Thisfactisknown
asFermat’s theorem.
Theorem 4.2:Fermat’s Theorem
If f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c, then f′(c)=0.
Proof
Suppose f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c. We need to show that f′(c)=0. To do this, we
willshowthat f′(c)≥0 and f′(c)≤0, andtherefore f′(c)=0. Since f hasalocalextremumat c, f hasalocal
maximum or local minimum at c. Suppose f has a local maximum at c. The case in which f has a local minimum
at c can be handled similarly. There then exists an open interval I such that f(c)≥ f(x) for all x∈I. Since f is
differentiable at c, from the definition of the derivative, we know that
f(x)− f(c)
f′(c)= lim .
x→c x−c
Since this limit exists, both one-sided limits also exist and equal f′(c). Therefore,

f′(c)= lim ,
+ x−c
x→c
and
f(x)− f(c) (4.5)
f′(c)= lim .
− x−c
x→c
Since f(c) is a local maximum, we see that f(x)− f(c)≤0 for x near c. Therefore, for x near c, but x>c,
f(x)− f(c)
wehave ≤0. FromEquation 4.4weconcludethat f′(c)≤0. Similarly,itcanbeshownthat f′(c)≥0.
x−c
Therefore, f′(c)=0.
□
FromFermat’stheorem,weconcludethatif f hasalocalextremumat c, theneither f′(c)=0 or f′(c) isundefined.
In other words, local extrema can only occur at critical points.

Note this theorem does not claim that a function f must have a local extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that

be a critical point. We summarize this result in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.3:Location of Absolute Extrema
Let f be a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval I. The absolute maximum of f over I and the
absolute minimum of f over I must occur at endpoints of I or at critical points of f in I.
With this idea in mind, let’s examine a procedure for locating absolute extrema.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Locating Absolute Extrema over a Closed Interval
Consider a continuous function f defined over the closed interval [a, b].
1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x=a and x=b.
2. Find all critical points of f that lie over the interval (a, b) and evaluate f at those critical points.
3. Compareallvaluesfoundin(1)and(2).FromLocationofAbsoluteExtrema,theabsoluteextremamust

smallest of these values is the absolute minimum of f.

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 373
Now let’s look at how to use this strategy to find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values for continuous
functions.
Example 4.13
Locating Absolute Extrema
Foreachofthefollowingfunctions,findtheabsolutemaximumandabsoluteminimumoverthespecifiedinterval
and state where those values occur.
a. f(x)=−x 2 +3x−2 over [1, 3].
b. f(x)= x 2 −3x 2/3 over [0, 2].
Solution
a. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x=1 and x=3.
f(1)=0and f(3)=−2
Step2.Since f′(x)=−2x+3, f′ isdefinedforallrealnumbers x. Therefore,therearenocritical
points where the derivative is undefined. It remains to check where f′(x)=0. Since
f′(x)=−2x+3=0 at x= 3 and 3 isintheinterval [1, 3], f ⎛3⎞ isacandidateforanabsolute

Learning Objectives
4.4.1 Explain the meaning of Rolle’s theorem.
4.4.2 Describe the significance of the Mean Value Theorem.
4.4.3 State three important consequences of the Mean Value Theorem.
TheMeanValueTheoremisoneofthemostimportanttheoremsincalculus.Welookatsomeofitsimplicationsatthe
end of this section. First, let’s start with a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, called Rolle’s theorem.
Rolle’s Theorem
Informally,Rolle’stheoremstatesthatiftheoutputsofadifferentiablefunction f areequalattheendpointsofaninterval,
then there must be an interior point c where f′(c)=0. Figure 4.21illustrates this theorem.
Figure 4.21 If a differentiable functionfsatisfies f(a)= f(b), then its derivative must be zero at some point(s)
between a and b.
Theorem 4.4:Rolle’s Theorem
Let f beacontinuousfunctionovertheclosedinterval [a, b] anddifferentiableovertheopeninterval (a, b) such
that f(a)= f(b). There then exists at least one c∈(a, b) such that f′(c)=0.
Proof
Let k= f(a)= f(b). We consider three cases:
1. f(x)=k for all x∈(a, b).
2. There exists x∈(a, b) such that f(x)>k.
3. There exists x∈(a, b) such that f(x)<k.
Case 1: If f(x)=k for all x∈(a, b), then f′(x)=0 for all x∈(a, b).
Case2:Since f isacontinuousfunctionovertheclosed,boundedinterval [a, b], bytheextremevaluetheorem,ithas

k. Therefore,theabsolutemaximumdoesnotoccurateitherendpoint.Asaresult,theabsolutemaximummustoccuratan
interiorpoint c∈(a, b). Because f hasamaximumataninteriorpoint c, and f isdifferentiableat c, byFermat’s
theorem, f′(c)=0.

Case3:Thecasewhenthereexistsapoint x∈(a, b) suchthat f(x)<k isanalogoustocase2,withmaximumreplaced
by minimum.

evenatasinglepoint,theresultmaynothold.Forexample,thefunction f(x)=|x|−1 iscontinuousover [−1, 1] and
f(−1)=0= f(1), but f′(c)≠0 for any c∈(−1, 1) as shown in the following figure.
Figure 4.22 Since f(x)=|x|−1 is not differentiable at
x=0, the conditions of Rolle’s theorem are not satisfied. In
fact, the conclusion does not hold here; there is no c∈(−1, 1)
such that f′(c)=0.
Let’s now consider functions that satisfy the conditions of Rolle’s theorem and calculate explicitly the points c where
f′(c)=0.
Example 4.14
Using Rolle’s Theorem

b. f(x)= x 3 −4x over [−2, 2]
Solution
a. Since f isapolynomial,itiscontinuousanddifferentiableeverywhere.Inaddition, f(−2)=0= f(0).
Therefore, f satisfies the criteria of Rolle’s theorem. We conclude that there exists at least one value
c∈(−2, 0) such that f′(c)=0. Since f′(x)=2x+2=2(x+1), we see that
f′(c)=2(c+1)=0 implies c=−1 as shown in the following graph.

b. As in part a. f is a polynomial and therefore is continuous and differentiable everywhere. Also,
f(−2)=0= f(2). That said, f satisfies the criteria of Rolle’s theorem. Differentiating, we find that
f′(x)=3x 2 −4. Therefore, f′(c)=0 when x=± 2 . Bothpointsareintheinterval [−2, 2], and,

Figure 4.26 The value g(x) is the vertical difference
between the point (x, f(x)) and the point (x, y) on the secant
line connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)).
Since the graph of f intersects the secant line when x=a and x=b, we see that g(a)=0=g(b). Since f is a
differentiablefunctionover (a, b), g isalsoadifferentiablefunctionover (a, b). Furthermore,since f iscontinuous
over [a, b], g isalsocontinuousover [a, b]. Therefore, g satisfiesthecriteriaofRolle’stheorem.Consequently,there
exists a point c∈(a, b) such that g′(c)=0. Since

Corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem
Let’snowlookatthreecorollariesoftheMeanValueTheorem.Theseresultshaveimportantconsequences,whichweuse
in upcoming sections.
At this point, we know the derivative of any constant function is zero. The Mean Value Theorem allows us to conclude
that the converse is also true. In particular, if f′(x)=0 for all x in some interval I, then f(x) is constant over that
interval. This result may seem intuitively obvious, but it has important implications that are not obvious, and we discuss
them shortly.
Theorem 4.6:Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zero
Let f be differentiable over an interval I. If f′(x)=0 for all x∈I, then f(x)= constant for all x∈I.
Proof
Since f isdifferentiableover I, f mustbecontinuousover I. Suppose f(x) isnotconstantforall x in I. Thenthere
exist a, b∈I, where a≠b and f(a)≠ f(b). Choose the notation so that a<b. Therefore,
f(b)− f(a)
≠0.
b−a
Since f is a differentiable function, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists c∈(a, b) such that
f(b)− f(a)
f′(c)= .
b−a
Therefore, there exists c∈I such that f′(c)≠0, which contradicts the assumption that f′(x)=0 for all x∈I.
□
From Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zero, it follows that if two functions have the same derivative,
they differ by, at most, a constant.
Theorem 4.7:Corollary 2: Constant Difference Theorem
If f and g aredifferentiableoveraninterval I and f′(x)=g′(x) forall x∈I, then f(x)=g(x)+C forsome
constant C.
Proof
Let h(x)= f(x)−g(x). Then, h′(x)= f′(x)−g′(x)=0 forall x∈I. ByCorollary1,thereisaconstant C suchthat
h(x)=C for all x∈I. Therefore, f(x)=g(x)+C for all x∈I.
□
ThethirdcorollaryoftheMeanValueTheoremdiscusseswhenafunctionisincreasingandwhenitisdecreasing.Recall
that a function f is increasing over I if f(x )< f(x ) whenever x < x , whereas f is decreasing over I if
1 2 1 2
f(x) > f(x ) whenever x < x . Using the Mean Value Theorem, we can show that if the derivative of a function is
1 2 1 2
positive, then the function is increasing; if the derivative is negative, then the function is decreasing (Figure 4.29). We

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 387
Figure 4.29 If a function has a positive derivative over some interval I, then the function
increases over that interval I; if the derivative is negative over some interval I, then the
function decreases over that interval I.
Theorem 4.8:Corollary 3: Increasing and Decreasing Functions
Let f be continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b).
i. If f′(x)>0 for all x∈(a, b), then f is an increasing function over [a, b].
ii. If f′(x)<0 for all x∈(a, b), then f is a decreasing function over [a, b].
Proof
Wewillprovei.;theproofofii.issimilar.Suppose f isnotanincreasingfunctionon I. Thenthereexist a and b in I
suchthat a<b, but f(a)≥ f(b). Since f isadifferentiablefunctionover I, bytheMeanValueTheoremthereexists
c∈(a, b) such that
f(b)− f(a)
f′(c)= .
b−a
Since f(a)≥ f(b), we know that f(b)− f(a)≤0. Also, a<b tells us that b−a>0. We conclude that
f(b)− f(a)
f′(c)= ≤0.
b−a
However, f′(x)>0 for all x∈I. This is a contradiction, and therefore f must be an increasing function over I.

A continuous function f has a local maximum at point c if and only if f switches from increasing to decreasing at
point c. Similarly, f hasalocalminimumat c ifandonlyif f switchesfromdecreasingtoincreasingat c. If f isa
continuousfunctionoveraninterval I containing c anddifferentiable over I, except possiblyat c, theonlyway f
can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at point c is if f′ changes sign as x increases through c. If
f is differentiable at c, the only way that f′. can change sign as x increases through c is if f′(c)=0. Therefore,
forafunction f thatiscontinuousoveraninterval I containing c anddifferentiableover I, exceptpossiblyat c, the
onlyway f canswitchfromincreasingtodecreasing(orviceversa)isif f′(c)=0 or f′(c) isundefined.Consequently,
to locate local extrema for a function f, we look for points c in the domain of f such that f′(c)=0 or f′(c) is
undefined. Recall that such points are called critical points of f.
Notethat f neednothavealocalextremaatacriticalpoint.Thecriticalpointsarecandidatesforlocalextremaonly.In

Figure 4.31 The function f has four critical points: a, b, c, andd. The function f has local maxima at a
and d, and a local minimum at b. The function f does not have a local extremum at c. The sign of f′
changes at all local extrema.
UsingFigure 4.31, we summarize the main results regarding local extrema.
• If a continuous function f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point c.
• The function has a local extremum at the critical point c if and only if the derivative f′ switches sign as x
increases through c.
• Therefore, to test whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point c, we must determine the sign of
f′(x) to the left and right of c.
This result is known as thefirst derivative test.

Theorem 4.9:First Derivative Test
Supposethat f isacontinuousfunctionoveraninterval I containingacriticalpoint c. If f isdifferentiableover
I, except possibly at point c, then f(c) satisfies one of the following descriptions:
i. If f′ changessignfrompositivewhen x<c tonegativewhen x>c, then f(c) isalocalmaximumof f.
ii. If f′ changessignfromnegativewhen x<c topositivewhen x>c, then f(c) isalocalminimumof f.
iii. If f′ hasthesamesignfor x<c and x>c, then f(c) isneitheralocalmaximumnoralocalminimumof
f.
We can summarize the first derivative test as a strategy for locating local extrema.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Using the First Derivative Test
Consider a function f that is continuous over an interval I.
1. Find all critical points of f and divide the interval I into smaller intervals using the critical points as
endpoints.
2. Analyze the sign of f′ in each of the subintervals. If f′ is continuous over a given subinterval (which is
typicallythecase),thenthesignof f′ inthatsubintervaldoesnotchangeand,therefore,canbedetermined
bychoosinganarbitrarytestpoint x inthatsubintervalandbyevaluatingthesignof f′ atthattestpoint.Use
the sign analysis to determine whether f is increasing or decreasing over that interval.
3. UseFirst Derivative Testandtheresultsofstep 2 todeterminewhether f hasalocalmaximum,alocal
minimum, or neither at each of the critical points.
Now let’s look at how to use this strategy to locate all local extrema for particular functions.
Example 4.17
Using the First Derivative Test to Find Local Extrema
Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for f(x)= x 3 −3x 2 −9x−1. Use a
graphing utility to confirm your results.
Solution
Step1.Thederivativeis f′(x)=3x 2 −6x−9. Tofindthecriticalpoints,weneedtofindwhere f′(x)=0.
Factoring the polynomial, we conclude that the critical points must satisfy
3(x 2 −2x−3)=3(x−3)(x+1)=0.
Therefore, the critical points are x=3, −1. Now divide the interval (−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals
(−∞, −1), (−1, 3)and(3, ∞).
Step 2. Since f′ is a continuous function, to determine the sign of f′(x) over each subinterval, it suffices to
chooseapointovereachoftheintervals (−∞, −1), (−1, 3)and(3, ∞) anddeterminethesignof f′ ateach

(−∞, −1) x=−2 (+)(−)(−)= + f is increasing.
(−1, 3) x=0 (+)(−)(+)=− f is decreasing.
(3, ∞) x=4 (+)(+)(+)= + f is increasing.
Step3.Since f′ switchessignfrompositivetonegativeas x increasesthrough 1, f hasalocalmaximumat
x=−1. Since f′ switchessignfromnegativetopositiveas x increasesthrough 3, f hasalocalminimumat
x=3. These analytical results agree with the following graph.

Example 4.18
Using the First Derivative Test
Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for f(x)=5x 1/3 −x 5/3 . Use a graphing

Solution
Step 1. The derivative is
⎛ 4/3⎞
5 −2/3 5 2/3 5 5x 2/3 5−5x 4/3 5 ⎝ 1−x ⎠
f′(x)= x − x = − = = .
3 3 3x 2/3 3 3x 2/3 3x 2/3
The derivative f′(x)=0 when 1−x 4/3 =0. Therefore, f′(x)=0 at x=±1. The derivative f′(x) is
undefined at x=0. Therefore, we have three critical points: x=0, x=1, and x=−1. Consequently,
divide the interval (−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, −1), (−1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, ∞).
Step 2: Since f′ is continuous over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a test point x in each of the
intervals from step 1 and determine the sign of f′ at each of these points. The points
x=−2, x= − 1 , x= 1 , andx=2 are test points for these intervals.

Figure 4.34(a) shows a function f with a graph that curves upward. As x increases, the slope of the tangent line

To determine concavity, we need to find the second derivative f″(x). The first derivative is

iscontinuousoveranopeninterval I containing a. Suppose f″(a)<0. Since f″ iscontinuousover I, f″(x)<0 for
all x∈I (Figure4.38).Then,byCorollary 3, f′ isadecreasingfunctionover I. Since f′(a)=0, weconcludethat
forall x∈I, f′(x)>0 if x<a and f′(x)<0 if x>a. Therefore,bythefirstderivativetest, f hasalocalmaximum
at x=a. Ontheotherhand,supposethereexistsapoint b suchthat f′(b)=0 but f″(b)>0. Since f″ iscontinuous
over an open interval I containing b, then f″(x)>0 for all x∈I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3, f′ is an
increasing function over I. Since f′(b)=0, we conclude that for all x∈I, f′(x)<0 if x<b and f′(x)>0 if
x>b. Therefore, by the first derivative test, f has a local minimum at x=b.

400 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Figure 4.38 Consider a twice-differentiable function f such
that f″ is continuous. Since f′(a)=0 and f″(a)<0,
there is an interval I containing a such that for all x in I, f
is increasing if x<a and f is decreasing if x>a. As a
result, f has a local maximum at x=a. Since f′(b)=0
and f″(b)>0, there is an interval I containing b such that
for all x in I, f is decreasing if x<b and f is increasing
if x>b. As a result, f has a local minimum at x=b.
Theorem 4.11:Second Derivative Test
Suppose f′(c)=0, f″ is continuous over an interval containing c.
i. If f″(c)>0, then f has a local minimum at c.
ii. If f″(c)<0, then f has a local maximum at c.
iii. If f″(c)=0, then the test is inconclusive.
Note that for case iii. when f″(c)=0, then f may have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at c. For
example, the functions f(x)= x 3 , f(x)= x 4 , and f(x)=−x 4 all have critical points at x=0. In each case, the

Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes
Recall that lim f(x)=L means f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to L as long as x is sufficiently close to a. We can

extend this idea to limits at infinity. For example, consider the function f(x)=2+ 1 . As can be seen graphically in

More generally, for any function f, we say the limit as x→∞ of f(x) is L if f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to
L as long as x is sufficiently large. In that case, we write lim f(x)=L. Similarly, we say the limit as x→−∞ of
x→∞
f(x) is L if f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to L as long as x<0 and |x| is sufficiently large. Inthat case, we write
lim f(x)=L. We now look at the definition of a function having a limit at infinity.

Infinite Limits at Infinity
Sometimes the values of a function f become arbitrarily large as x→∞ (or as x→−∞). In this case, we write
lim f(x)=∞ (or lim f(x)=∞). Ontheotherhand,ifthevaluesof f arenegativebutbecomearbitrarilylargein

x→∞ x→−∞
For example, consider the function f(x)= x 3 . As seen in Table 4.3 and Figure 4.47, as x→∞ the values f(x)
become arbitrarily large. Therefore, lim x 3 =∞. On the other hand, as x→−∞, the values of f(x)= x 3 are
x→∞
negative but become arbitrarily large in magnitude. Consequently, lim x 3 =−∞.

Guidelines for Drawing the Graph of a Function
We now have enough analytical tools to draw graphs of a wide variety of algebraic and transcendental functions. Before
showing how to graph specific functions, let’s look at a general strategy to use when graphing any function.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Drawing the Graph of a Function
Given a function f, use the following steps to sketch a graph of f:
1. Determine the domain of the function.
2. Locate the x- and y-intercepts.
3. Evaluate lim f(x) and lim f(x) todeterminetheendbehavior.Ifeitheroftheselimitsisafinitenumber

p(x)
anobliqueasymptote.If f isarationalfunctionsuchthat f(x)= , wherethedegreeofthenumerator
q(x)
is greater than the degree of the denominator, then f can be written as
p(x) r(x)
f(x)= =g(x)+ ,
q(x) q(x)
wherethedegreeof r(x) islessthanthedegreeof q(x). Thevaluesof f(x) approachthevaluesof g(x) as

426 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
x→±∞. If g(x) is a linear function, it is known as anoblique asymptote.
4. Determine whether f has any vertical asymptotes.
5. Calculate f′. Find all critical points and determine the intervals where f is increasing and where f is
decreasing. Determine whether f has any local extrema.
6. Calculate f″. Determine the intervals where f is concave up and where f is concave down. Use this
informationtodeterminewhether f hasanyinflectionpoints.Thesecondderivativecanalsobeusedasan
alternate means to determine or verify that f has a local extremum at a critical point.
Now let’s use this strategy to graph several different functions. We start by graphing a polynomial function.
Example 4.28
Sketching a Graph of a Polynomial
Sketch a graph of f(x)=(x−1)2(x+2).
Solution
Step 1. Since f is a polynomial, the domain is the set of all real numbers.
Step2.When x=0, f(x)=2. Therefore,the y-interceptis (0, 2). Tofindthe x-intercepts,weneedtosolve
the equation (x−1)2(x+2)=0, gives us the x-intercepts (1, 0) and (−2, 0)
Step3.Weneedtoevaluatetheendbehaviorof f. As x→∞, (x−1)2 →∞ and (x+2)→∞. Therefore,
lim f(x)=∞. As x→−∞, (x−1)2 →∞ and (x+2)→−∞. Therefore, lim f(x)=−∞. Toget
x→∞ x→−∞
evenmoreinformationabouttheendbehaviorof f, wecanmultiplythefactorsof f. Whendoingso,wesee
that
f(x)=(x−1)2(x+2)=
x
3
−3x+2.
Since the leading term of f is x 3 , we conclude that f behaves like y= x 3 as x→±∞.
Step 4. Since f is a polynomial function, it does not have any vertical asymptotes.
Step 5. The first derivative of f is
f′(x)=3x 2 −3.
Therefore, f hastwocriticalpoints: x=1, −1. Dividetheinterval (−∞, ∞) intothethreesmallerintervals:
(−∞, −1), (−1, 1), and (1, ∞). Then, choose test points x=−2, x=0, and x=2 from these
intervals and evaluate the sign of f′(x) at each of these test points, as shown in the following table.

Interval Test Sign of Derivative Conclusion
Point f′(x)=3x 2 −3=3(x−1)(x+1)
(−∞, −1) x=−2 (+)(−)(−)= + f is
increasing.
(−1, 1) x=0 (+)(−)(+)=− f is
decreasing.
(1, ∞) x=2 (+)(+)(+)= + f is
increasing.
From the table, we see that f has a local maximum at x=−1 and a local minimum at x=1. Evaluating
f(x) atthosetwopoints,wefindthatthelocalmaximumvalueis f(−1)=4 andthelocalminimumvalueis
f(1)=0.
Step 6. The second derivative of f is
f″(x)=6x.
The second derivative is zero at x=0. Therefore, to determine the concavity of f, divide the interval
(−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞), and choose test points x=−1 and x=1 to
determine the concavity of f on each of these smaller intervals as shown in the following table.
Interval Test Point Sign of f″(x)=6x Conclusion
(−∞, 0) x=−1 − f is concave down.
(0, ∞) x=1 + f is concave up.
We note that the information in the preceding table confirms the fact, found in step 5, that f has a local
maximumat x=−1 andalocalminimumat x=1. Inaddition,theinformationfoundinstep 5—namely, f
has a local maximum at x=−1 and a local minimum at x=1, and f′(x)=0 at those points—combined
with the fact that f″ changes sign only at x=0 confirms the results found in step 6 on the concavity of f.
Combining this information, we arrive at the graph of f(x)=(x−1)2(x+2) shown in the following graph.

concavity at x=−1 and x=1, there are no inflection points at either of these places because f is not
continuous at x=−1 or x=1.

Example 4.32, we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden. Certainly, if we keep making the side
lengths of the garden larger, the area will continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how
muchfencingwecanusefortheperimeter?Inthiscase,wecannotmakethegardenaslargeaswelike.Let’slookathow
we can maximize the area of a rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.
Example 4.32
Maximizing the Area of a Garden
A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of the garden and wire fencing for the
other three sides (Figure 4.62). Given 100 ft of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a
garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?
Figure 4.62 We want to determine the measurements x and
y that will create a garden with a maximum area using 100 ft
of fencing.
Solution
Let x denotethelengthofthesideofthegardenperpendiculartotherockwalland y denotethelengthofthe
side parallel to the rock wall. Then the area of the garden is
A= x·y.

440 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Wewanttofindthemaximumpossibleareasubjecttotheconstraintthatthetotalfencingis 100ft. FromFigure
4.62, the total amount of fencing used will be 2x+y. Therefore, the constraint equation is
2x+y=100.
Solving this equation for y, we have y=100−2x. Thus, we can write the area as
A(x)= x·(100−2x)=100x−2x 2 .
Before trying to maximize the area function A(x)=100x−2x 2 , we need to determine the domain under
consideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive.
Therefore,weneed x>0 and y>0. Since y=100−2x, if y>0, then x<50. Therefore,wearetrying
todeterminethemaximumvalueof A(x) for x overtheopeninterval (0, 50). Wedonotknowthatafunction
necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do know that a continuous function has
an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let’s consider the function
A(x)=100x−2x 2 over the closed interval ⎡0, 50⎤. If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then
⎣ ⎦
we have found the value x in the open interval (0, 50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we
consider the following problem:
Maximize A(x)=100x−2x 2 over the interval ⎡0, 50⎤.
⎣ ⎦
As mentioned earlier, since A is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value
theorem,ithasamaximumandaminimum.Theseextremevaluesoccureitheratendpointsorcriticalpoints.At
theendpoints, A(x)=0. Sincetheareaispositiveforall x intheopeninterval (0, 50), themaximummust
occur at a critical point. Differentiating the function A(x), we obtain
A′(x)=100−4x.
Therefore,theonlycriticalpointis x=25 (Figure4.63).Weconcludethatthemaximumareamustoccurwhen
x=25. Thenwehave y=100−2x=100−2(25)=50. Tomaximizetheareaofthegarden,let x=25 ft
and y=50ft. The area of this garden is 1250ft 2 .
Figure 4.63 To maximize the area of the garden, we need to find the
maximum value of the function A(x)=100x−2x 2 .

Now let’s look at a general strategy for solving optimization problems similar toExample 4.32.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Optimization Problems
1. Introduce all variables. If applicable, draw a figure and label all variables.
2. Determinewhichquantityistobemaximizedorminimized,andforwhatrangeofvaluesoftheothervariables
(if this can be determined at this time).
3. Write a formula for the quantity to be maximized or minimized in terms of the variables. This formula may
involve more than one variable.
4. Write any equations relating the independent variables in the formula from step 3. Use these equations to
write the quantity to be maximized or minimized as a function of one variable.
5. Identify the domain of consideration for the function in step 4 based on the physical problem to be solved.
6. Locatethemaximumorminimumvalueofthefunctionfromstep 4. Thissteptypicallyinvolveslookingfor
critical points and evaluating a function at endpoints.
Nowlet’sapplythisstrategytomaximizethevolumeofanopen-topboxgivenaconstraintontheamountofmaterialtobe

Example 4.33
Maximizing the Volume of a Box
An open-top box is to be made from a 24 in. by 36 in. piece of cardboard by removing a square from each
corneroftheboxandfoldinguptheflapsoneachside.Whatsizesquareshouldbecutoutofeachcornertoget
a box with the maximum volume?
Solution
Step 1: Let x be the side length of the square to be removed from each corner (Figure 4.64). Then, the
remaining four flaps can be folded up to form an open-top box. Let V be the volume of the resulting box.

442 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Figure 4.64 A square with side length x inches is removed from each
corner of the piece of cardboard. The remaining flaps are folded to form an
open-top box.
Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the problem is to maximize V.
Step 3: As mentioned in step 2, are trying to maximize the volume of a box. The volume of a box is
V =L·W·H, where L, W, andH are the length, width, and height, respectively.
Step4:FromFigure4.64,weseethattheheightoftheboxis x inches,thelengthis 36−2x inches,andthe
width is 24−2x inches. Therefore, the volume of the box is
V(x)=(36−2x)(24−2x)x=4x 3 −120x 2 +864x.
Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let’s examine Figure 4.64. Certainly, we need x>0.
Furthermore,thesidelengthofthesquarecannotbegreaterthanorequaltohalfthelengthoftheshorterside, 24
in.;otherwise,oneoftheflapswouldbecompletelycutoff.Therefore,wearetryingtodeterminewhetherthere
isamaximumvolumeoftheboxfor x overtheopeninterval (0, 12). Since V isacontinuousfunctionover
the closed interval [0, 12], we know V will have an absolute maximum over the closed interval. Therefore,
weconsider V overtheclosedinterval [0, 12] andcheckwhethertheabsolutemaximumoccursataninterior
point.
Step6:Since V(x) isacontinuousfunctionovertheclosed,boundedinterval [0, 12], V musthaveanabsolute
maximum (and an absolute minimum). Since V(x)=0 at the endpoints and V(x)>0 for 0< x<12, the
maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is
V′(x)=12x 2 −240x+864.
To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation
2
12x −240x+864=0.
Dividing both sides of this equation by 12, the problem simplifies to solving the equation
2
x −20x+72=0.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the critical points are
20± (−20)2 −4(1)(72) 20± 112 20±4 7
x= = = =10±2 7.

Since 10+2 7 isnotinthedomainofconsideration,theonlycriticalpointweneedtoconsideris 10−2 7.
Therefore, the volume is maximized if we let x=10−2 7in. The maximum volume is
V(10−2 7)=640+448 7≈1825in. 3 as shown in the following graph.

444 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Figure 4.66 How can we choose x and y to minimize the travel time from
the cabin to the island?
Step 2: The problem is to minimize T.
Step3:Tofindthetimespenttravelingfromthecabintotheisland,addthetimespentrunningandthetimespent

Therefore, the total time spent traveling is

8 3
Step 4: From Figure 4.66, the line segment of y miles forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs
of length 2mi and 6−xmi. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, 2 2 +(6−x)2 =y 2 , and we obtain
y= (6−x)2 +4. Thus, the total time spent traveling is given by the function

T(x)= + .

Step 5: FromFigure 4.66, we see that 0≤ x≤6. Therefore, ⎡0, 6⎤ is the domain of consideration.

Therefore,

Squaring both sides of this equation, we see that if x satisfies this equation, then x must satisfy

⎡ (6−x)2

which implies

We conclude that if x is a critical point, then x satisfies

Therefore, the possibilities for critical points are

Since x=6+6/ 55 is not in the domain, it is not a possibility for a critical point. On the other hand,
x=6−6/ 55 isinthedomain.SincewesquaredbothsidesofEquation4.6toarriveatthepossiblecritical

and compare them with the value of T(x) at the critical point x=6−6/ 55. We find that T(0)≈2.108h

Example 4.35
Maximizing Revenue
Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge customers p dollars per day to rent a
car, where 50≤ p≤200, the number of cars n they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function

446 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
n(p)=1000−5p. If they charge $50 per day or less, they will rent all their cars. If they charge $200 per
dayormore,theywillnotrentanycars.Assumingtheownersplantochargecustomersbetween$50perdayand
$200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?
Solution
Step1:Let p bethepricechargedpercarperdayandlet n bethenumberofcarsrentedperday.Let R bethe
revenue per day.
Step 2: The problem is to maximize R.
Step3:Therevenue(perday)isequaltothenumberofcarsrentedperdaytimesthepricechargedpercarper
day—that is, R=n× p.
Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear function n(p)=1000−5p, the
revenue R can be represented by the function
R(p)=n× p=⎛1000−5p⎞p=−5p 2 +1000p.
⎝ ⎠
Step5:Sincetheownersplantochargebetween $50 percarperdayand $200 percarperday,theproblemis
to find the maximum revenue R(p) for p in the closed interval ⎡50, 200⎤.
⎣ ⎦
Step 6: Since R is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval ⎡50, 200⎤, it has an absolute
⎣ ⎦
maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points.
The derivative is R′(p)=−10p+1000. Therefore, the critical point is p=100 When p=100,
R(100)=$50,000. When p=50, R(p)=$37,500. When p=200, R(p)=$0. Therefore,theabsolute
maximum occurs at p=$100. The car rental company should charge $100 per day per car to maximize
revenue as shown in the following figure.
Figure 4.67 To maximize revenue, a car rental company has to
balance the price of a rental against the number of cars people
will rent at that price.

Figure 4.68 We want to maximize the area of a rectangle inscribed in an

Step6:Asmentionedearlier, A(x) isacontinuousfunctionovertheclosed,boundedinterval [0, 2]. Therefore,
it has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum). At the endpoints x=0 and x=2, A(x)=0. For

Minimizing Surface Area
Arectangularboxwithasquarebase,anopentop,andavolumeof 216 in.3istobeconstructed.Whatshould
the dimensions of the box be to minimize the surface area of the box? What is the minimum surface area?
Solution
Step 1:Drawarectangular boxandintroduce the variable x torepresent the length ofeach side ofthe square
base; let y represent the height of the box. Let S denote the surface area of the open-top box.
Figure 4.69 We want to minimize the surface area of a

Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to minimize S.
Step3:Sincetheboxhasanopentop,weneedonlydeterminetheareaofthefourverticalsidesandthebase.
Theareaofeachofthefourverticalsidesis x·y. Theareaofthebaseis x 2 . Therefore,thesurfaceareaofthe

S=4xy+x .
Step 4: Since the volume of this box is x 2 y and the volume is given as 216in. 3 , the constraint equation is

Therefore, S(x)= 864 +x 2 .

Step 5: Since we are requiring that x 2 y=216, we cannot have x=0. Therefore, we need x>0. On the
other hand, x is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as x becomes large, the height of the box
y becomes correspondingly small so that x 2 y=216. Similarly, as x becomes small, the height of the box
becomescorrespondinglylarge.Weconcludethatthedomainistheopen,unboundedinterval (0, ∞). Notethat,

Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule
L’Hôpital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Consider

For the first of these examples, we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing

lim = lim = lim (x+2)=2+2=4.

Figure 4.71 If lim f(x)= lim g(x), then the ratio f(x)/g(x) is

approximately equal to the ratio of their linear approximations near a.
Since f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a, and therefore f(a)= lim f(x)=0. Similarly,
x→a
g(a)= lim g(x)=0. If we also assume that f′ and g′ are continuous at x=a, then f′(a)= lim f′(x) and

Growth Rates of Functions
Suppose the functions f and g both approach infinity as x→∞. Although the values of both functions become
arbitrarily large as the values of x become sufficiently large, sometimes one function is growing more quickly than the
other. For example, f(x)= x 2 and g(x)= x 3 both approach infinity as x→∞. However, as shown in the following
table, the values of x 3 are growing much faster than the values of x 2 .
x 10 100 1000 10,000
f(x)=x 2 100 10,000 1,000,000 100,000,000

lim = lim x=∞.or, equivalently, lim = lim =0.

As a result, we say x 3 is growing more rapidly than x 2 as x→∞. On the other hand, for f(x)= x 2 and
g(x)=3x 2 +4x+1, althoughthevaluesof g(x) arealwaysgreaterthanthevaluesof f(x) for x>0, eachvalueof
g(x) is roughly three times the corresponding value of f(x) as x→∞, as shown in the following table. In fact,

In this case, we say that x 2 and 3x 2 +4x+1 are growing at the same rate as x→∞.
Moregenerally,suppose f and g aretwofunctionsthatapproachinfinityas x→∞. Wesay g growsmorerapidlythan

On the other hand, if there exists a constant M ≠0 such that
f(x)
lim =M,
x→∞g(x)
we say f and g grow at the same rate as x→∞.

Next we see how to use L’Hôpital’s rule to compare the growth rates of power, exponential, and logarithmic functions.

Therefore, e x grows more rapidly than x 2 as x→∞ (SeeFigure 4.73andTable 4.9).

Describing Newton’s Method
Consider the task of finding the solutions of f(x)=0. If f is the first-degree polynomial f(x)=ax+b, then the
solution of f(x)=0 is given by the formula x= − b . If f is the second-degree polynomial f(x)=ax 2 +bx+c,

Forexample,considerthetaskoffindingsolutionsof tan(x)−x=0. Nosimpleformulaexistsforthesolutionsofthis

Newton’s method makes use of the following idea to approximate the solutions of f(x)=0. By sketching a graph of
f, we can estimate a root of f(x)=0. Let’s call this estimate x . We then draw the tangent line to f at x . If

1 2 3 4 5
Solution
From Figure 4.78, we see that f has one root over the interval (1, 2). Therefore x =2 seems like
0
a reasonable first approximation. To find the next approximation, we use Equation 4.8. Since
f(x)= x 3 −3x+1, the derivative is f′(x)=3x 2 −3. Using Equation 4.8 with n=1 (and a calculator
that displays 10 digits), we obtain
x = x − f(x 0 ) =2− f(2) =2− 3 ≈1.666666667.

To find the next approximation, x , we use Equation 4.8 with n=2 and the value of x stored on the

5
x ≈1.532088886.

We note that we obtained the same value for x and x . Therefore, any subsequent application of Newton’s
5 6
method will most likely give the same value for xn.

Failures of Newton’s Method
Typically,Newton’smethodisusedtofindrootsfairlyquickly.However,thingscangowrong.SomereasonswhyNewton’s
method might fail include the following:
1. Atoneoftheapproximations xn, thederivative f′ iszeroat xn, but f(xn)≠0. Asaresult,thetangentlineof
f at xn does not intersect the x-axis. Therefore, we cannot continue the iterative process.

3. Theapproximationsmayfailtoapproacharootentirely.InExample 4.48,weprovideanexampleofafunction

approximations continue to alternate back and forth between two values.

Figure 4.80 If the initial guess x is too far from the root sought, it may lead
0
to approximations that approach a different root.

When Newton’s Method Fails
Considerthefunction f(x)= x 3 −2x+2. Let x =0. Showthatthesequence x , x ,… failstoapproacha
0 1 2
root of f.
Solution
For f(x)= x 3 −2x+2, the derivative is f′(x)=3x 2 −2. Therefore,
x = x − f(x 0 ) =0− f(0) = − 2 =1.
1 0 f′(x ) f′(0) −2

In the next step,
x = x − f(x 1 ) =1− f(1) =1− 1 =0.

Consequently,thenumbers x , x , x ,… continuetobouncebackandforthbetween 0 and 1 andneverget

is the derivative of the velocity v(t)—that is, a(t)=v′(t)=s″(t). Now suppose we are given an acceleration function
a, but not the velocity function v or the position function s. Since a(t)=v′(t), determining the velocity function
requires us to find an antiderivative of the acceleration function. Then, since v(t)=s′(t), determining the position
function requires us to find an antiderivative of the velocity function. Rectilinear motion is just one case in which the

Definition
A function F is anantiderivativeof the function f if
F′(x)= f(x)
for all x in the domain of f.
Consider the function f(x)=2x. Knowing the power rule of differentiation, we conclude that F(x)= x 2 is an
antiderivativeof f since F′(x)=2x. Arethereanyotherantiderivativesof f? Yes;sincethederivativeofanyconstant
C iszero, x 2 +C isalsoanantiderivativeof 2x. Therefore, x 2 +5 and x 2 − 2 arealsoantiderivatives.Arethereany
others that are not of the form x 2 +C for some constant C? The answer is no. From Corollary 2 of the Mean Value
Theorem, we know that if F and G are differentiable functions such that F′(x)=G′(x), then F(x)−G(x)=C for
some constant C. This fact leads to the following important theorem.

486 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Theorem 4.14:General Form of an Antiderivative
Let F be an antiderivative of f over an interval I. Then,
i. for each constant C, the function F(x)+C is also an antiderivative of f over I;
ii. if G is an antiderivative of f over I, there is a constant C for which G(x)=F(x)+C over I.
In other words, the most general form of the antiderivative of f over I is F(x)+C.
We use this fact and our knowledge of derivatives to find all the antiderivatives for several functions.
Example 4.50
Finding Antiderivatives
For each of the following functions, find all antiderivatives.
a. f(x)=3x 2
b. f(x)= 1
x
c. f(x)=cosx
d. f(x)=e x
Solution
a. Because

dx⎝ ⎠
then F(x)= x 3 is an antiderivative of 3x 2 . Therefore, every antiderivative of 3x 2 is of the form
x 3 +C for some constant C, and every function of the form x 3 +C is an antiderivative of 3x 2 .
b. Let f(x)=ln|x|. For x>0, f(x)=ln(x) and
d 1

For x<0, f(x)=ln(−x) and

so F(x)=sinx is an antiderivative of cosx. Therefore, every antiderivative of cosx is of the form

d. Since
d (e x)=e x ,

then F(x)=e x isanantiderivativeof e x . Therefore,everyantiderivativeof e x isoftheform e x +C

From the definition of indefinite integral of f, we know
∫ f(x)dx=F(x)+C

490 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
if and only if F is an antiderivative of f. Therefore, when claiming that
∫ f(x)dx=F(x)+C
it is important to check whether this statement is correct by verifying that F′(x)= f(x).

Therefore, the statement
∫xe x dx= xe x −e x +C
is correct.
Note that we are verifying an indefinite integral for a product. The antiderivative xe x −e x is not
a product of the antiderivatives. Furthermore, the product of antiderivatives, x 2 e x /2 is not an
antiderivative of xe x since
d ⎛ x 2 e x⎞ x x 2 e x x

Therefore, F(x)+G(x) is an antiderivative of f(x)+g(x) and we have

Similarly,
∫⎛f(x)−g(x)⎞dx=F(x)−G(x)+C.

In addition, consider the task of finding an antiderivative of kf(x), where k is any real number. Since

for any real number k, we conclude that

Initial-Value Problems

the text. Here we turn to one common use for antiderivatives that arises often in many applications: solving differential
equations.
Adifferential equationis an equation that relates an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. The equation
dy (4.9)
= f(x)
dx
is a simple example of a differential equation. Solving this equation means finding a function y with a derivative f.
Therefore,thesolutionsofEquation4.9aretheantiderivativesof f. If F isoneantiderivativeof f, everyfunctionof
the form y=F(x)+C is a solution of that differential equation. For example, the solutions of
dy 2
=6x

are given by
y=∫6x 2 dx=2x 3 +C.

looking for a function y that satisfies the differential equation

function y thatalsosatisfiestheinitialcondition,weneedtofind C suchthat y(1)=2(1) 3 +C=5. Fromthisequation,
we see that C=3, and we conclude that y=2x 3 +3 is the solution of this initial-value problem as shown in the
following graph.

constant rate of 15 ft/sec2.
a. How many seconds elapse before the car stops?
b. How far does the car travel during that time?
Solution
a. First we introduce variables for this problem. Let t be the time (in seconds) after the brakes are first
applied.Let a(t) betheaccelerationofthecar(infeetpersecondssquared)attime t. Let v(t) bethe
velocityofthecar(infeetpersecond)attime t. Let s(t) bethecar’sposition(infeet)beyondthepoint
where the brakes are applied at time t.
Thecaristravelingatarateof 88ft/sec. Therefore,theinitialvelocityis v(0)=88 ft/sec.Sincethecar
is decelerating, the acceleration is
a(t)=−15ft/s 2 .
The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity,
v′(t)=−15.
Therefore, we have an initial-value problem to solve:
v′(t)=−15, v(0)=88.
Integrating, we find that
v(t)=−15t+C.
Since v(0)=88, C=88. Thus, the velocity function is
v(t)=−15t+88.
To find how long it takes for the car to stop, we need to find the time t such that the velocity is zero.
Solving −15t+88=0, we obtain t= 88 sec.

knowthevelocity v(t) isthederivativeoftheposition s(t). Considertheinitialpositiontobe s(0)=0.
Therefore, we need to solve the initial-value problem
s′(t)=−15t+88, s(0)=0.

496 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Integrating, we have
s(t)= − 15 t 2 +88t+C.

Since s(0)=0, the constant is C=0. Therefore, the position function is
s(t)= − 15 t 2 +88t.

Determining distance from velocity is just one of many applications of integration. In fact, integrals are used in a wide
variety of mechanical and physical applications. In this chapter, we first introduce the theory behind integration and use
integralstocalculateareas.Fromthere,wedeveloptheFundamentalTheoremofCalculus,whichrelatesdifferentiationand
integration. We then study some basic integration techniques and briefly examine some applications.
5.1 | Approximating Areas
Learning Objectives
5.1.1 Use sigma (summation) notation to calculate sums and powers of integers.
5.1.2 Use the sum of rectangular areas to approximate the area under a curve.
5.1.3 Use Riemann sums to approximate area.

Inthissection,wedeveloptechniquestoapproximatetheareabetweenacurve,definedbyafunction f(x), andthex-axis
on a closed interval ⎡a, b⎤. Like Archimedes, we first approximate the area under the curve using shapes of known area

(namely,rectangles).Byusingsmallerandsmallerrectangles,wegetcloserandcloserapproximationstothearea.Taking
a limit allows us to calculate the exact area under the curve.

somenewnotationhere,calledsigmanotation(alsoknownassummationnotation).TheGreekcapitalletter Σ, sigma,
is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1 to 20
without sigma notation, we have to write
1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+17+18+19+20.
We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write
1+2+3+4+⋯+19+20,
which is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation, we write this sum as
20
∑ i,
i=1
which is much more compact.
Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form

Chapter 5 | Integration 513
We can use this regular partition as the basis of a method for estimating the area under the curve. We next examine two
methods: the left-endpoint approximation and the right-endpoint approximation.
Rule: Left-Endpoint Approximation
On each subinterval [x , x] (for i=1, 2, 3,…,n), construct a rectangle with width Δx and height equal to
i−1 i
f(x ), which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle is
i−1
f(x )Δx. Addingtheareasofalltheserectangles,wegetanapproximatevalueforA(Figure 5.3).Weusethe

The notation Rn indicates this is aright-endpoint approximationforA(Figure 5.4).

514 Chapter 5 | Integration
Figure 5.4 In the right-endpoint approximation of area under
a curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the
function value at the right of each subinterval. Note that the
right-endpoint approximation differs from the left-endpoint
approximation inFigure 5.3.
2
The graphs in Figure 5.5 represent the curve f(x)= x . In graph (a) we divide the region represented by the interval
2
[0, 3] into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus, Δx=0.5. We then form six rectangles by drawing vertical lines
perpendicular to x , the left endpoint of each subinterval. We determine the height of each rectangle by calculating
i−1
f(x ) for i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Theintervalsare ⎡0, 0.5⎤, ⎡0.5, 1⎤, ⎡1, 1.5⎤, ⎡1.5, 2⎤, ⎡2, 2.5⎤, ⎡2.5, 3⎤. Wefindthearea

Thus,

Figure 5.10 Here, 32 rectangles are inscribed under the curve
for a left-endpoint approximation.
We can carry out a similar process for the right-endpoint approximation method. A right-endpoint approximation of the
same curve, using four rectangles (Figure 5.11), yields an area
R = f(0.5)(0.5)+ f(1)(0.5)+ f(1.5)(0.5)+ f(2)(0.5)

Figure 5.11 Now we divide the area under the curve into four
equal subintervals for a right-endpoint approximation.
Dividing the region over the interval [0, 2] into eight rectangles results in Δx= 2−0 =0.25. The graph is shown in

Figure 5.12. The area is
R = f(0.25)(0.25)+ f(0.5)(0.25)+ f(0.75)(0.25)+ f(1)(0.25)

Figure 5.12 Here we use right-endpoint approximation for a
region divided into eight equal subintervals.
Last, the right-endpoint approximation with n=32 is close to the actual area (Figure 5.13). The area is approximately
R = f(0.0625)(0.0625)+ f(0.125)(0.0625)+ f(0.1875)(0.0625)+⋯+ f(2)(0.0625)

Net Signed Area
Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function f(x)=2−2x 2 (shown in Figure 5.17) on
⎧
the interval [0, 2]. Use n=8 and choose ⎨x* } as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each
⎩ i
subinterval of height f⎛x* ⎞ and width Δx. When f⎛x* ⎞ is positive, the product f⎛x* ⎞Δx represents the area of the

rectangle,asbefore.When f⎛x* ⎞ isnegative,however,theproduct f⎛x* ⎞Δx representsthenegativeoftheareaofthe

Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let’s examine another important theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Integrals and
Antiderivatives
As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful theorem that establishes the
relationshipbetweendifferentiationandintegration,andgivesusawaytoevaluatedefiniteintegralswithoutusingRiemann
sums or calculating areas. The theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration.
Theorem 5.4:Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1
If f(x) is continuous over an interval ⎡a, b⎤, and the function F(x) is defined by

Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a reason it is called the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a relationship between integration and differentiation, but
alsoitguaranteesthatanyintegrablefunctionhasanantiderivative.Specifically,itguaranteesthatanycontinuousfunction
has an antiderivative.
Proof
Applying the definition of the derivative, we have
F(x+h)−F(x)
F′(x) = lim

Analysis
Notice that we did not include the “+ C” term when we wrote the antiderivative. The reason is that, according
to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, any antiderivative works. So, for convenience, we chose the
antiderivativewith C=0. Ifwehadchosenanotherantiderivative,theconstanttermwouldhavecanceledout.
This always happens when evaluating a definite integral.

Therefore, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., the car traveled a total of 110 mi.
To summarize, net displacement may include both positive and negative values. In other words, the velocity function
accounts for both forward distance and backward distance. To find net displacement, integrate the velocity function over
theinterval.Totaldistancetraveled,ontheotherhand,isalwayspositive.Tofindthetotaldistancetraveledbyanobject,
regardless of direction, we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity function.

Integrating Even and Odd Functions
We saw in Functions and Graphs that an even function is a function in which f(−x)= f(x) for all x in the
domain—that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when x is replaced with −x. The graphs of even functions are
symmetricaboutthey-axis.Anoddfunctionisoneinwhich f(−x)=−f(x) forallxinthedomain,andthegraphofthe
function is symmetric about the origin.
Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from −a to a, involve two equal areas, because they are
symmetric aboutthey-axis.Integrals ofoddfunctions,whenthelimits ofintegration aresimilarly [−a, a], evaluate to
zero because the areas above and below thex-axis are equal.

Let u=g(x), , where g′(x) iscontinuousoveraninterval,let f(x) becontinuousoverthecorrespondingrangeof

Letf,g,u, andFbe as specified in the theorem. Then

Integrating both sides with respect tox, we see that

If we now substitute u=g(x), and du=g'(x)dx, we get

Integrals of Exponential Functions
The exponential function is perhaps the most efficient function in terms of the operations of calculus. The exponential
function, y=e x , is its own derivative and its own integral.

Example 5.40
Finding a Price–Demand Equation
Findtheprice–demandequationforaparticularbrandoftoothpasteatasupermarketchainwhenthedemandis
50tubesperweekat$2.35pertube,giventhatthemarginalprice—demandfunction, p′(x), forxnumberof
tubes per week, is given as
−0.01x
p'(x)=−0.015e .
If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?
Solution
Tofindtheprice–demandequation,integratethemarginalprice–demandfunction.Firstfindtheantiderivative,
then look at the particulars. Thus,
p(x) =∫−0.015e −0.01x dx
=−0.015∫e −0.01x dx.
Using substitution, let u=−0.01x and du=−0.01dx. Then, divide both sides of the du equation by −0.01.
This gives
−0.015∫e u du =1.5∫e u du
−0.01
u
=1.5e +C
−0.01x

ThenextstepistosolveforC.Weknowthatwhenthepriceis$2.35pertube,thedemandis50tubesperweek.
This means

598 Chapter 5 | Integration
−0.01(50)
p(50) =1.5e +C
=2.35.
Now, just solve forC:
−0.5
C =2.35−1.5e
=2.35−0.91
=1.44.
Thus,
−0.01x
p(x)=1.5e +1.44.
If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price would be
−0.01(100) −1
p(100)=1.5e +1.44=1.5e +1.44≈1.99.
The supermarket should charge $1.99 per tube if it is selling 100 tubes per week.

Again, substitution is the method to use. Let u=1−x, so du=−1dx or −du=dx. Then

The area of a typical rectangle goes from one curve to the other.

6.2.2 Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the disk method.
6.2.3 Find the volume of a solid of revolution with a cavity using the washer method.
In the preceding section, we used definite integrals to find the area between two curves. In this section, we use definite
integrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches—slicing, disks, and washers—for
finding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid.

Rather than looking at an example of the washer method with the y-axis as the axis of revolution, we now consider an
example in which the axis of revolution is a line other than one of the two coordinate axes. The same general method
applies, but you may have to visualize just how to describe the cross-sectional area of the volume.

below by the x-axis over the interval [0, 4] around the line y=−2.

The graph of the region and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure.

Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a region R, bounded above by the graph of a
function y= f(x), belowbythe x-axis, andontheleftandrightbythelines x=a and x=b, respectively,asshown

Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate
(Figure 6.28).

To calculate the volume of the entire solid, we then add the volumes of all the shells and obtain

the density of the rod at any point, x. Let ρ(x) be an integrable linear density function. Now, for i=0, 1, 2,…, n let

We state this result in the following theorem.

We apply this theorem in the next example.
Example 6.23
Calculating Mass from Linear Density
Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval [π/2, π]. If the density of the rod is given by
ρ(x)=sinx, what is the mass of the rod?

6.23 Considerathinrodorientedonthex-axisovertheinterval [1, 3]. Ifthedensityoftherodisgivenby
ρ(x)=2x 2 +3, what is the mass of the rod?
We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius r. As with the rod we looked at in
the one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a
two-dimensional object. We assume the density is given in terms of mass per unit area (called area density), and further
assume the density varies only along the disk’s radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the xy-plane, with
the center at the origin. Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of x, denoted ρ(x). We assume
ρ(x) is integrable. Because density is a function of x, we partition the interval from [0, r] along the x-axis. For
i=0, 1, 2,…, n, let P={x} bearegularpartitionoftheinterval [0, r], andfor i=1, 2,…, n, chooseanarbitrary
i
point x* ∈[x , x]. Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-dimensional) washers. A disk and a

Work Done by a Force
Wenowconsiderwork.Inphysics,workisrelatedtoforce,whichisoftenintuitivelydefinedasapushorpullonanobject.
When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In other words, work can be thought of as the
amountofenergyittakestomoveanobject.Accordingtophysics,whenwehaveaconstantforce,workcanbeexpressed
as the product of force and distance.

When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to
compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or
stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.

Solution
First find the spring constant, k. When x=−0.2, we know F(x)=−10, so
F(x) = kx
−10 = k(−0.2)
k = 50
and F(x)=50x. Then, to calculate work, we integrate the force function, obtaining

For pumping problems, the calculations vary depending on the shape of the tank or container. The following problem-
solving strategy lays out a step-by-step process for solving pumping problems.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Pumping Problems
1. Sketch a picture of the tank and select an appropriate frame of reference.
2. Calculate the volume of a representative layer of water.
3. Multiply the volume by the weight-density of water to get the force.
4. Calculate the distance the layer of water must be lifted.

Hydrostatic Force and Pressure
Inthislastsection,welookattheforceandpressureexertedonanobjectsubmergedinaliquid.IntheEnglishsystem,force
is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the English
systemwehavepoundspersquarefoot(or,perhapsmorecommonly,poundspersquareinch,denotedpsi).Inthemetric
system we have newtons per square meter, also calledpascals.
Let’sbeginwiththesimplecaseofaplateofarea A submergedhorizontallyinwateratadepths(Figure6.56).Then,the

density ofwater (weight perunitvolume). Tofindthehydrostaticpressure—that is,thepressureexerted bywater ona
submerged object—we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is p=F/A= ρs.

Assume the top edge of the plate is at point x=a and the bottom edge of the plate is at point x=b. Then, for
i=0, 1, 2,…, n, let P={x} bearegularpartitionoftheinterval ⎡a, b⎤, andfor i=1, 2,…, n, chooseanarbitrary

Center of Mass and Moments
Let’sbeginbylookingatthecenterofmassinaone-dimensionalcontext.Consideralong,thinwireorrodofnegligible
mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 6.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses m and m at
1 2
distances d and d from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown inFigure 6.62(b).

Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if m d =m d .

In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However,
we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by
movingthefulcrum.Supposewehavetwopointmasses, m and m , locatedonanumberlineatpoints x and x ,

Center of Mass of Thin Plates
So far we have looked at systems ofpoint masses ona line and in a plane. Now,instead ofhaving the mass ofa system
concentrated at discrete points, we want to look at systems in which the mass of the system is distributed continuously
acrossathinsheetofmaterial.Forourpurposes,weassumethesheetisthinenoughthatitcanbetreatedasifitistwo-
dimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this
section, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.

Theorem 6.11:The Symmetry Principle
If a regionRis symmetric about a linel, then the centroid ofRlies onl.

these quantities by partitioning the interval ⎡a, b⎤ and constructing rectangles.

For i=0, 1, 2,…, n, let P={x} be a regular partition of ⎡a, b⎤. Recall that we can choose any point within the

interval [x , x] asour x* . Inthiscase,wewant x* tobethex-coordinateofthecentroidofourrectangles.Thus,for

i i−1 i i i i−1 i
Now, for i=1, 2,…, n, construct a rectangle of height f⎛x* ⎞ on [x , x]. The center of mass of this rectangle is
⎝ i ⎠ i−1 i

Next,weneedtofindthetotalmassoftherectangle.Let ρ representthedensityofthelamina(notethat ρ isaconstant).
Inthiscase, ρ isexpressedintermsofmassperunitarea.Thus,tofindthetotalmassoftherectangle,wemultiplythearea
of the rectangle by ρ. Then, the mass of the rectangle is given by ρf(x* )Δx.

To get the approximate mass of the lamina, we add the masses of all the rectangles to get

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n→∞ gives the exact mass of the lamina:

Next,wecalculatethemomentofthelaminawithrespecttothex-axis.Returningtotherepresentativerectangle,recallits
center of mass is ⎛ x* , ⎛f(x* )⎞/2 ⎞ . Recall also that treating the rectangle as if it is a point mass located at the center of
⎝ i ⎝ i ⎠ ⎠
mass does not change the moment. Thus, the moment of the rectangle with respect to the x-axis is given by the mass of
the rectangle, ρf(x* )Δx, multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the x-axis: ⎛f(x* )⎞/2. Therefore, the
i ⎝ i ⎠
momentwithrespecttothex-axisoftherectangleis ρ ⎛⎡f(x* )⎤2 /2 ⎞ Δx. Addingthemomentsoftherectanglesandtaking

We find the coordinates of the center of mass by dividing the moments by the total mass to give

cancels out when – x and – y are calculated.
We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

Since we are only asked for the centroid of the region, rather than the mass or moments of the associated
lamina, we know the density constant ρ cancels out of the calculations eventually. Therefore, for the sake of

Now that we have the natural logarithm defined, we can use that function to define the number e.
Definition
The number e is defined to be the real number such that
lne=1.

Figure 6.77 The area under the curve from 1 to e is equal

The number e can be shown to be irrational, although we won’t do so here (see the Student Project in Taylor and
Maclaurin Series (http://cnx.org/content/m53817/latest/)). Its approximate value is given by
e≈2.71828182846.
The Exponential Function
Wenowturnourattention tothe function e x . Note that the natural logarithm isone-to-one andtherefore hasaninverse
function. For now, we denote this inverse function by expx. Then,
exp(lnx)= xforx>0andln(expx)= xfor allx.
The following figure shows the graphs of expx and lnx.
Figure 6.78 The graphs of lnx and expx.
We hypothesize that expx=e x . For rational values of x, this is easy to show. If x is rational, then we have
ln(e x)= xlne= x. Thus, when x is rational, e x =expx. For irrational values of x, we simply define e x as the
inverse function of lnx.

Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration 727
Definition
For any real number x, define y=e x to be the number for which
lny=ln(e x)= x. (6.25)
Then we have e x =exp(x) for all x, and thus
e lnx = xforx>0andln(e x)= x (6.26)
for all x.
Properties of the Exponential Function
Since the exponential function was defined in terms of an inverse function, and not in terms of a power of e, we must
verify that the usual laws of exponents hold for the function e x .

If p and q are any real numbers and r is a rational number, then
i. e p e q =e p+q
ii. e p =e p−q

iii. (e p)r =e pr

Note that if p and q are rational, the properties hold. However, if p or q are irrational, we must apply the inverse

have
ln(e p e q)=ln(e p)+ln(e q)= p+q=ln ⎛ e p+q⎞ .

e e =e .

General Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
Weclosethissection bylookingatexponential functionsandlogarithms withbasesotherthan e. Exponential functions
arefunctionsoftheform f(x)=a x . Notethatunless a=e, westilldonothaveamathematically rigorousdefinition
of these functions for irrational exponents. Let’s rectify that here by defining the function f(x)=a x in terms of the
exponential function e x . We then examine logarithms with bases other than e as inverse functions of exponential
functions.
Definition
For any a>0, and for any real number x, define y=a x as follows:

properties of exponents hold for general exponential functions defined in this way.
Let’s now apply this definition to calculate a differentiation formula for a x . We have
d x d xlna xlna x
a = e =e lna=a lna.

The corresponding integration formula follows immediately.

and

If a≠1, then the function a x is one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse. Its inverse is denoted by logax. Then,
y
y=logaxif and only ifx=a .
Note that general logarithm functions can be written in terms of the natural logarithm. Let y=logax. Then, x=a y .
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this second equation, we get
lnx = ln(a y)
lnx = ylna

log x = .

Thus, we see that all logarithmic functions are constant multiples of one another. Next, we use this formula to find a
differentiation formula for a logarithm with base a. Again, let y=logax. Then,

growth models, we must always be careful to interpret the function values in the context of the phenomenon we are
modeling.
Example 6.42
Population Growth
Consider the population of bacteria described earlier. This population grows according to the function
f(t)=200e 0.02t , where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 5
hours (300 minutes)? When does the population reach 100,000 bacteria?
Solution
We have f(t)=200e 0.02t . Then
0.02(300)
f(300)=200e ≈80,686.
There are 80,686 bacteria in the population after 5 hours.
To find when the population reaches 100,000 bacteria, we solve the equation

100,000 = 200e

Let’snowturnourattentiontoafinancialapplication:compoundinterest.Interestthatisnotcompoundediscalledsimple
interest.Simple interest is paid once, at the end ofthe specified time period (usually 1 year). So,if we put $1000 in a
savings account earning 2% simple interest per year, then at the end of the year we have
1000(1+0.02)=$1020.
Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period. Therefore, if the bank
compounds the interest every 6 months, it credits half of the year’s interest to the account after 6 months. During the

Now let’s manipulate this expression so that we have an exponential growth function. Recall that the number e can be
expressed as a limit:
m
⎛ 1⎞
e= lim 1+ .
m→∞⎝ m⎠
Based onthis, we want the expression inside the parentheses to have the form (1+1/m). Let n=0.02m. Note that as
n→∞, m→∞ as well. Then we get

P = 135,335.28.
She must invest $135,335.28 at 5% interest.

thereare 1000 fishinthepond.Theownerwillallowhisfriendsandneighborstofishonhispondafterthefish
population reaches 10,000. When will the owner’s friends be allowed to fish?
Solution
We know it takes the population of fish 6 months to double in size. So, if t represents time in months,
by the doubling-time formula, we have 6=(ln2)/k. Then, k=(ln2)/6. Thus, the population is given by
y=500e ⎛ ⎝(ln2)/6⎞ ⎠t . To figure out when the population reaches 10,000 fish, we must solve the following

The following figure shows a graph of a representative exponential decay function.

Let’s look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton’s law of cooling says that an object cools at a rate

if T represents the temperature of the object and Ta represents the ambient temperature in a room, then

Table 6.2Derivatives of the
Hyperbolic Functions
Let’s take a moment to compare the derivatives of the hyperbolic functions with the derivatives of the standard
trigonometric functions. There are a lot of similarities, but differences as well. For example, the derivatives of the sine
functionsmatch: (d/dx)sinx=cosx and (d/dx)sinhx=coshx. Thederivativesofthecosinefunctions,however,differ
insign: (d/dx)cosx=−sinx, but (d/dx)coshx=sinhx. Aswecontinueourexaminationofthehyperbolicfunctions,
we must be mindful of their similarities and differences to the standard trigonometric functions.
These differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions lead directly to the following integral formulas.
∫sinhudu = coshu+C ∫csch 2 udu = −cothu+C
∫coshudu = sinhu+C ∫sechutanhudu = −sechu+C
∫sech 2 udu = tanhu+C ∫cschucothudu = −cschu+C

• The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a surface of revolution.
• Theintegralsgeneratedbyboththearclengthandsurfaceareaformulasareoftendifficulttoevaluate.Itmaybe
necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of the integrals.
6.5Physical Applications
• Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics.
• Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known.
• Workcanalsobecalculated fromintegrating aforcefunction,orwhencounteracting theforceofgravity,asina
pumping problem.
• Definite integrals can also be used to calculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a liquid.
6.6Moments and Centers of Mass
• Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be
concentratedwithoutchangingthemoment.Looselyspeaking,thecenterofmasscanbethoughtofasthebalancing
point of the system.
• For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is

M = ∑ m x. For point masses distributed in a plane, the moments of the system with respect to the x- and

• The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis, the volume of the
resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance traveled by the centroid of the region.
6.7Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms
• Theearliertreatmentoflogarithmsandexponentialfunctionsdidnotdefinethefunctionspreciselyandformally.
This section develops the concepts in a mathematically rigorous way.
• The cornerstone of the development is the definition of the natural logarithm in terms of an integral.
• The function e x is then defined as the inverse of the natural logarithm.
• General exponential functions are defined in terms of e x , and the corresponding inverse functions are general
logarithms.

760 Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration
• Familiar properties of logarithms and exponents still hold in this more rigorous context.
6.8Exponential Growth and Decay
• Exponential growth and exponential decay are two of the most common applications of exponential functions.
• Systems that exhibit exponential growth follow a model of the form y=y e kt .
0
• In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present. In other words, y′=ky.
• Systems that exhibit exponential growth have a constant doubling time, which is given by (ln2)/k.
• Systems that exhibit exponential decay follow a model of the form y=y e −kt .
0
• Systems that exhibit exponential decay have a constant half-life, which is given by (ln2)/k.
6.9Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions
• Hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions.
• Term-by-term differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. These differentiation
formulas give rise, in turn, to integration formulas.
• With appropriate range restrictions, the hyperbolic functions all have inverses.
• Implicitdifferentiationyieldsdifferentiationformulasfortheinversehyperbolicfunctions,whichinturngiverise
to integration formulas.
• The most common physical applications of hyperbolic functions are calculations involving catenaries.

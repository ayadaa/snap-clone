# User Story #6: Daily Math Challenge - Implementation Progress

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Backend Complete, ⏳ Frontend Ready for Implementation  
**Project:** Snap Factor

---

## 📋 User Story Overview

**User Story #6**: "As a student, I want to receive a daily 'Math Snap Challenge' tailored to my grade level (e.g., 3rd-grade multiplication, 11th-grade trigonometry), so that I can solve it and share my solution."

---

## ✅ Completed Backend Implementation

### 🚀 Cloud Functions Deployed

Successfully deployed **3 new Cloud Functions** to Firebase:

1. **`generateDailyChallenge`** - Creates new daily challenges using RAG
2. **`submitChallengeAnswer`** - Processes and scores user submissions  
3. **`getDailyChallenge`** - Retrieves today's challenge for a grade level

**Deployment Status:** ✅ All functions deployed successfully to `snapclone-b4718`

### 🧠 RAG Integration

- **✅ Connected to existing RAG system** - Leverages OpenAI + Pinecone for challenge generation
- **✅ Grade-appropriate content** - Generates challenges tailored to specific grade levels
- **✅ Educational quality** - Uses textbook content for accurate, curriculum-aligned problems
- **✅ Hint system** - Provides helpful guidance without giving away answers

### 📊 Challenge Scoring & Progress

- **✅ Intelligent scoring** - Uses OpenAI to evaluate answers with partial credit
- **✅ Streak tracking** - Maintains daily challenge streaks for motivation
- **✅ Points system** - Awards points based on difficulty (10/15/25 points)
- **✅ Progress statistics** - Tracks accuracy, total challenges, best streaks

### 🗄️ Database Schema

**Firestore Collections:**
- `dailyChallenges` - Stores generated challenges with 24-hour expiration
- `challengeSubmissions` - Records user answers and scores
- `users/{userId}/challengeProgress` - Individual user statistics

### 🔧 Service Layer

**Created comprehensive service layer:**
- `src/services/firebase/challenges.service.ts` - Complete API interface
- `src/hooks/challenges/use-daily-challenge.ts` - React hook for state management
- Full TypeScript interfaces and error handling

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 📚 Grade Level Targeting
- **Elementary (1st-3rd):** Easy problems, 10 points
- **Middle School (4th-8th):** Medium problems, 15 points  
- **High School (9th-12th):** Hard problems, 25 points

### 🎮 Gamification Elements
- **Daily Streaks** - Consecutive correct answers
- **Points System** - Accumulate points for achievements
- **Difficulty Progression** - Challenges scale with grade level
- **Progress Tracking** - Detailed statistics and history

### 🤖 AI-Powered Features
- **Smart Generation** - RAG creates relevant, educational problems
- **Intelligent Scoring** - Considers multiple valid answer formats
- **Encouraging Feedback** - Positive reinforcement regardless of correctness
- **Hint System** - Guides learning without spoiling solutions

### 📱 Submission Types
- **Text Answers** - Direct text input for solutions
- **Image Submissions** - Photo of handwritten work (uses Vision API)
- **Flexible Evaluation** - Handles both typed and written responses

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Environment Requirements
- **Node.js 20** for Cloud Functions (MANDATORY)
- **OpenAI API Key** for challenge generation and evaluation
- **Pinecone API Key** for RAG content retrieval
- **Firebase project** with Firestore and Functions enabled

### Performance Considerations
- Challenges cached for 24 hours to reduce API costs
- Batch operations for user statistics updates
- Optimized queries with proper Firestore indexing
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Security Implementation
- User authentication required for all operations
- Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on challenge generation
